<h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span>	Is this right for you?</h5>
<p class="text-justify">We invite bright and motivated people to maximize their experience by being a part of this strong team of content writers. Prospective applicants can choose from part-time and full-time commitment and can shift from one to another based on time commitments by giving us prior notice. Part-Time participation requires a commitment of about 20 hours per week and full-time participation requires about 40 hours a week. Regardless of what level of commitment you make initially, you can work on your own schedule and convenience. Full-time participants will have weekly goals and must be willing to promptly complete assignments. Under special circumstances where an assignment will be delayed, prior intimation will help us reassign priority projects.</p>

<br/>
<p class="text-justify">All communication with BizAcumen will be through the Internet via e-mail and web. Training, guidelines, and support will be provided to participants, who will have independent password- driven access to BizAcumen intranet.</p>

<br/>
<p class="text-justify">Project requirements and research materials will be sent to you directly and you will deliver completed materials, reports, etc., back to us. If your work requires improvement or does not qualify, we will explain clearly the problems and give you another try. Due to the simplicity of the requirements, very few serious participants have problems.</p>

<br/>

<p class="text-justify">This is an excellent opportunity - only one-of-its-kind in India, for individuals seeking an opportunity to earn at their own pace.</p>

<br/>

<h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></span>	Quality Of Life </h5>
<p class="text-justify">With evolving technology, increasing traffic congestion and the increasing desire for quality time at home, telecommuting is increasingly becoming a mainstream career alternative for professionals. If you are a non-linear thinker and are looking to evolve innovative career approaches and have a strong interest in business research and analysis, this might be the only job you might want to keep.</p>
<br/>

<h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span>	Freedom & Flexibility</h5>
<p class="text-justify">Candidates can set their own work pace based on availability of time, desire for additional income, etc. Our vision is to build a long-lasting relationship with moonlighters and convert them into a strong network of telecommuting employees. These individuals will get to enjoy the income, growth and challenges of a regular full-time BizAcumen employee, yet have the freedom to work at their own pace on their time.</p>

<br/>

<h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-education"></span>	Eligibility</h5>
<p class="text-justify">Participants must possess extraordinary English expression, highest quality editorial and profiling capability, and sound knowledge of business terminology.</p>
<br/>

<h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-briefcase"></span>	Simplified Compensation Process</h5>
<p class="text-justify">Compensation ranges from Rs. 70 to Rs. 150 per MS Word page based primarily on the quality of work delivered and the number of pages. High-quality edited content attracts a premium compensation ranging between Rs. 125 to Rs. 300. Our in-house evaluation team of editorial experts assesses the quality of work and other criteria to establish a payment rate for the participants. A continued effort will be made to improve participant’s contribution qualitatively, enabling better earning rate per page for the freelancer and a minimal quality control overhead at BizAcumen.</p>

                           <p>First and foremost, the contract writer has to read and comprehend data provided in the source feed. This will involve thorough reading of the content (including reading between-the-lines), detailed analysis of the situation, and identification of information strategic to the topical area (referred to as relevant information). Subsequent work will involve consolidation of ideas across the given content and presentation of information adhering to the guidelines in formal business expression. The source content has to be rewritten in a creative manner that lacks resemblance to the original idea discussed in the source and at the same time should deliver the same meaning.</p>
