What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In my view ,Yes, In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand.&amp;nbsp;But&amp;nbsp;most of the gap can be seen in rural areas .&amp;nbsp;This might be due to government is concentrating to develop only urban and metropolitan cities only its not concentrating in rural areas. Government is giving permissions to establish private hospitals in urban and metropolitan cities&amp;nbsp;only. And the economic growth of rural areas is very low when compared to urban and metropolitan cities .Government alone cannot be affordable to establish hospitals ,health camps &amp;nbsp;as its has many issues it has to concentrate&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;hospitals&amp;nbsp; so,&amp;nbsp;it should take initiative to encourage private hospitals with well infrastructure to establish them in rural areas . One of the reasons for the gap between health care supply and demand would be lack of knowledge about healthcare.As India is an agricultural country most of the people love to do cultivation , in that course they do not have sufficient time to study , so , there government should take necessary steps to conduct health campus , health awareness programes . In India literacy rate is&amp;nbsp;vey low when compared to other developed countries .&amp;nbsp;If government would concentrate on increasing the literacy rate surely this gap can be reduced.&amp;nbsp;We cannot bleam government alone , because ours is democratic government which means for the people , by the people and the people . So every citizen of India should contribute their work for the development of our nations. But in India educated people also behaving like uneducated. Everyone should follow the rules&amp;nbsp;and has to perform his duties correctly without corruption. Developing states are only developing but what about the rural areas ? their not even having proper healthcare campus , hospitals ,electricity , proper drinking water ,etc., .Not only health issues ,there several issues in which government has to look and take necessary steps , but alone government cannot change whole the country as a citizens of our country we have to contribute our own work for economic development of our country. For example: Most of doctors are from rural areas ,they done their primary and upper primary schooling in their villages and for higher education they will come to urban and metropolitan cities and some of them do their masters in abroad its good. But, after completing their studies they start their practice in metropolitan cities or in abroad why because they have spend lot of money during completion of their masters and they want to refund them . Individual having this type of knowledge should be changed . I feel our government should keep a rule for all the doctors that ,after completion of their masters they should work in rural areas for minimum of 5 years and then only they should&amp;nbsp;keep their practice in wherever they&amp;nbsp;want. If government would implement this type of rule surely government should meet the demand and the health care supply. Doctors should be given training about receiving the patient .&amp;nbsp; In government hospitals there is lack of patient care, proper management, &amp;nbsp;proper supervisors&amp;nbsp;.If government&amp;nbsp;would &amp;nbsp;concentrate on proper management , demand can meet the supply in health care sector. Because , suppose if we have invited our local MLA to our weeding event if we not receive him properly he wont come again when we invite him another time like wise patients should also received properly . There is a saying that ,&amp;quot;Half sickness of the patient will vanish&amp;nbsp;with the proper receiving by the doctor&amp;quot;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Finally I conclude that,&amp;nbsp; in order to meet the health care supply and demand ,everyone in the country should be given proper awareness of the healthcare issues by the government .Government should conduct health care camps in rural areas. As a citizens of India ,everyone who are educated should educate their family members and should do as much good as they can do for the development of our nation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
