Elaborate with examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India&amp;#39;s economic matters, there is an execessive tendency towards the thinking rather than doing. Its always said think before you take an action. But in India, things seem to be different. People think a lot before delivering the vulnerable action but unfortunately&amp;nbsp;the desired outcome&amp;nbsp;never happens. So whats the use of this thinking technology which eventually goes in sheer waste and utter dismay. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In recent times, there has been numerous ocassions where we have come across this situation. From a scam like commonwealth Games to 3 G Network, people had recieved nothing but fake assurance. India has got an indeginous past, but situation like this not only spoils the face of the nation but also leaves people of the nation aggrieved and filled with agony. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Its almost been over 2 years when common wealth games took place in our country. The people involved in the games could not adhere to the time lines given to finish the desired result due to which country had to earn a bad name across the world. They could not cater to the needs of the athletics properly. Now that the game is over and its almost been more than 2 years the situation seems wishy washy. Though the CBI team is there to probe the situation but does it take over 2 years to know the rootcause of the scam, people involved and sentence them with what they deserve. Things in the country is massively managed by politicians. So for them its all about finding the best resources involved in making money.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The most recent example revolves around the FDI which is foreign direct investment. Basically, which means that the retail sectors from foreign country would set up the market in India. This would make thing heywire initially but the fact that government in rule firmly believes that this would have a positive impact in India&amp;#39;s economy. Irrespective of the fact, whether common man has understood the basics and the literal meaning of FDI they expect support the common man. Outrageous, it is. How can the government in rule be insane? Could they not think of better option of increasing the inflation rate than bringing the foreign market into the country. Perhaps, the answer is no to this as well. They tend to think a lot with no result.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Can they not feel the agression common man have in their mind or do they pretend to be in different world where they are not answerable to anyone. Perhaps, they think they are the sole traders of the entire world. Though, the common man now knows what there rights are, special thanks goes to Anna Hazare, a veteran leader who took all the pain to explain this to common man. This has definitely attributed towards the humble cause raise by him through Lokpal Bill. But yet again, the government wants to make amendments to it rather than passing it in the Parliament house. So they are thinking to come up with necessary changes!. Who on earth other than themselves would better know what arey they thinking. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;On one hand, where common man is really trying hard to meet their basic needs government on the other hand keeps on increasing the prices of basic emmenities. Increase in fuel prices is the most common example. Government always thinks to reduce it but could not come up with that decision. Could they not curtail the excessive charges to give relief to common man or all they know is to make money and invest it in there profit making shares. I wish we could have&amp;nbsp;a better rule in the country where decision&amp;nbsp;are taken rightly and appropriately.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
