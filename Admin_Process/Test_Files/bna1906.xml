<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/27/2015 5:08:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Our dependence on computers has been increasing day by day tremendously. For everything we are dependent on computers even for a small task the need for computer is arising tremendously right from the schoool days and there has a been a drastic revolution &amp;nbsp;happening for performing every task. Nowadays people are becoming more dependent on computers . It has both pros and cons. As every work is being digitalized the use of paper has been reduced and the man power is also reduced in the industries due to the growing technology &amp;nbsp;advances. It is not good to be dependent overall on computers for performing every work the dependency should be reduced and we have to use the computers and its technology only if the human being cannot or not able to perform the task . With the use of computer and its technology the time taken to work is reduced when compared to the work performed by a human being manually.Due to the growth in the technology and Artificial Intelligence where all the work can be performed by an expert systems and robots the human intervention is becoming less. This dependence is not good for our overall development and may result in &amp;nbsp;drastic conditions. As the use of technology and dependence on computers increases the human intervention will go on decreasing where every task can be performed without an human intervention by artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lives are going to become more dependent on computers and technology advances by the result of new innovations in the technology where the work performed by humans will be less compared to the work performed by the technology advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase of dependence will result into where the technology will control the humans rather than the humans controlling or using the technology. Nowadays even for a small task like booking tickets and to travel any place or to talk with our relatives or friends technology is being used though it is time saving and can happen with less cost the more dependence on every task is not a good thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the use of technology should be reduced and we should concentrate on how to do a work by ourselves with limited or less use of computers and its technological advances. The growth in a mental level in human beings will be reduced, the thinking power and the overall growth in a human being will be reduced, the analytical skills and the innovations and inventions will come to a standstill &amp;nbsp;which result in the zero growth of the humanbeings more growth in the technology. The conclusion is the use for every small task of computers and its technological advances should be reduced for the overall development of the humans. The use should be up to a limit and over that the humans should not use the computers and its technological advances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013AutoIndustryOutlookforAsia&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next five to seven years the countries like China and India are expected to have a growth of 40% in the auto industry. &amp;nbsp;Ford anticipates global sales of 50% by 2015 mainly potential growth in China and India and rising demand for small cars and account for 55% of the total sales by 2020 compared with 48% presently where one third of the sales are expected to be from Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2012, Ford announced the plans which will boost the exports of its engine production from India by shiping them to Europe for the first time.Currently , the automaker exports 40% and 25% of its Indian -made cars and engines to 35 countries.It pumped in $2 billion to build manufacture &amp;nbsp;facilities in India to manufacture 450,000 cars and 600,000 engines by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To triple its exports from Chinese plants by 2015 General motors revealed plans to bild four new plants in china in order to boost annual production capacity to 5 million. GM as part of their major expansion program in china planning to invest $11 billion in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, when the Beijing government introduced a stimulus package China overtook the U.S. as the biggest auto market in the world by its sales vloume.China accounted for a third in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to control the traffic congestions the incentives were scrapped and the Beijing Govt. imposed quotas on new car registrations. In 2012, sales in china grew with a less percentage when compared to the previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Chinese Govt., total vehicle sales in China are expected to rise leading to a strong demand for passenger vehicles and economic recovery. As per the estimations by CAAM SUV`s will remain fastest-growing segment while commercial vehicles willrecord a moderate gain in its sales. By the overall estimations Asia promises high growth in the Auto Industry when compared to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 - Auto Industry Outlook for Asia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Asia Promises High Growth &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The Asian countries, especially China and India, are expected to account for 40% of growth in the auto industry over the next five to seven years being the rapidly growing economies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Ford anticipates global sales to expand by 50% to 8 million vehicles by 2015 given the potential growth in Asia, mainly China and India; and rising demand for small cars. The automaker anticipates small cars to account for 55% of the total sales by 2020 compared with 48% presently. One third of the small car sales are expected to come from Asia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In late 2012, Ford announced plans to boost exports of its engine production from India by shipping them for the first time to Europe. Currently, the automaker exports 40% of its Indian-made engines and 25% of its Indian-made cars to 35 countries. The company expects to manufacture 450,000 cars and 600,000 engines in India by 2015. It already pumped in $2 billion to build manufacturing facilities in India. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In April this year, General Motors revealed plans to build four new plants in China in order to boost annual production capacity to 5 million vehicles and triple its exports from Chinese plants by 2015. GM and its joint venture partners in China plan to invest $11 billion in the country by 2016 as part of their major expansion program. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In 2009, China overtook the U.S. as the biggest auto market in the world by sales volumes when the Beijing government introduced a stimulus package, including tax incentives for small cars. China accounted for a third of light vehicle sales growth in the last five years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However, the incentives were scrapped in 2011 and the Beijing government imposed quotas on new car registrations in order to control the traffic congestions. In 2012, sales in China grew 4.3% to 19.3 million units, which is lower than the 8% growth projected by China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) as well as the double-digit growth in 2009 and 2010. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the country are expected to improve if the government renews some of its policy incentives that helped the country overtake the U.S. as the biggest auto market. According to the Chinese government, total vehicle sales in China are expected to rise 7.8% to 20.8 million vehicles in 2013 from 19.3 million last year, led by strong demand for passenger vehicles and economic recovery. The CAAM believes SUVs will remain the fastest-growing segment in the year while commercial vehicles will record a moderate gain in sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
