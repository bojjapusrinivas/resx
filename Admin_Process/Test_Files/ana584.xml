Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion. the economic condition of a country is driven by its earning population and by Government strategies. Both these conditions are inter-dependent on each other. Apart from these two, othere factors such as eucation, proper investment and exposure to outsourcing too plays a critical role in controlling the economy of a country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Employed people contribute more towards the growing economy of the country. More employment means more tax returns, more accumulation in Govt&amp;#39;s funds. In India,&amp;nbsp;where the employment level is average, economic growth is very abrupt. Also, a high level of corruption too contributes to weak Indian economy. Government stratigies are very fragile compared to the country&amp;#39;s infrastructure. Compared to India, US has a very stringent and strong economic strategy. The employment quotient in US is very high than India and as I said, higher the&amp;nbsp;employment rate, higher will be the economic growth. In India, government stratigies have many flaws. It&amp;nbsp;is making&amp;nbsp;poor&amp;nbsp;poorer and rich richer. Also. a lack of proper education system has made people ignorant about their role in growing economy. They don&amp;#39;t understand that their money is actually driving the country. They are the backbone of country&amp;#39;s economy. The unemployment ratio in India comapred to US, is very high. They don&amp;#39;t know the importance of investment. So, it indirectly affects the economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;A foreign company investing in a country can boost the ecnomy many folds.&amp;nbsp;In India there is no any specific guidline for outsourcing. Government should take necessary steps to improve the outourcing scenarion in the country. Multi national companies investing in India have opened doors for better and more employment. So government should develop plans to attract more and more companies to India. An open invitation to outsourcing, is an another step towards economic growth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In total, there is no one sector or reason governing the economic condition of a country. All the factors are interdependent on each other. Government and the common&amp;nbsp;man, both have to&amp;nbsp;give their contribution to take the country on a road of economic growth and sustainability.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
