<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/4/2014 3:39:58 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With media publishing and telecasting irresponsibly, censorship is the need of the hour. Do you agree or disagree? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I agree with the statement given. Censorship would rate the quality of the picture so that people can view it if desired. In recent days, the media publishing and telecasting are crossing the thin line which&amp;nbsp;are causing effects to the society. So, censorship is essential to rate them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We have seen a tremendous increase in the growth rate of crime because of the impact of the movies on adults even as they attract much towards bad rather than good. Although there is a censor rating for the media publishing and telecasting we cannot prevent people viewing those according to the provided. The restricted one&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;also view them. For example, if a movie is rated as &amp;#39;A&amp;#39;&amp;nbsp;how many of the&amp;nbsp;theatres would prevent children&amp;nbsp;from entering into the&amp;nbsp;theatre as per the given rating?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;And even many of the news channels focuses on crime news rather than the life history of a great leader. It is not the fault of the media alone, people also tend towards watching crime news interestingly. So, to increase the TRP rating channels focuses on these stories. Recently I have read a story in a magazine, a child who is very intelligent and whose parents are well-educated. His mother and father both are lawyers. Every day the boy used to note down the news that are scrolling down. But one day he gets attracted towards the news that are viewed in the news channel about the actresses. By seeing those videos his mind gets disturbed and attempts rape on the daughter of the maid. The maid penalizes him and as his parents are lawyers they bring their son out without imprisonment. The boy later gets depressed of his act&amp;nbsp;and attempts suicide. This is not only a story, now-a-days this is happening in many of the metropolitan cities even who are really very educated.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Even with the presence of censor board, who can prevent children from watching those movies, etc. in television. The social media is also creating a negative impact on the children&amp;#39;s mind. As the parents are employed in most of the houses, children are getting diverted towards bad deeds.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Not only the children&amp;#39;s mind, the media is also spoiling the minds of youth who are the future of the country. For example in recent case of Tanishq, the thieves who stole the gold are in between the age group of 25-30 years. Although the thief is not educated and is a plumber, he planned it very systematically. If young adults use there intelligence for the good deeds it would definitely create better India. But the major cause for all these is the impact of media on the minds of the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Even with the presence of censorship, many of them do not care about the rating provided so as the media. So there must be strict rules to be imposed in the censorship to prevent such things happen. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
