Discuss in detail the impact of training and development on employee job performance.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In a highly competitive corporate world driven by excellence and constantly changing technology, the emphasis is on performance. In today`s cutthroat world, if one has to suceed in their chosen profession, one`s performance has to be consistent. An employee`s salary and any other perquisites and further growth&amp;nbsp;in the organistaion is solely determined by performance appraisals carried out annually. Perfomance of the employees is directly linked with the sucees of any organistion. If the employee job performance is not upto par, the impact can be seen&amp;nbsp;on the company`s market value which may lead to job terminations, thereby affecting employee morale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Normally when employees joins an organistaion, they are initially given induction training to familiarize themselves with the tasks and responsibilities they need to carry out in their respective jobs. Most&amp;nbsp;organisations set up a seperate training period for the new employees, whereas some organisations believe in the concept of on the job training by attaching the new employee under the guidance of an exeperienced employee. Whichever method of training is employed, the ultimate aim is to absorb the employee into the organistion a seamless manner. The world market which is in a constant state of flux because of the dynamic nature of technology, skills and knowledge tend to get outdated very quickly. In view of this, employees need regular training to develop&amp;nbsp;their skills further and update their knowledge. This training could be annual or bi-annual or as identified by the organistaion. Training is essential for every employee irrespective of their experience and their position in the organistaion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;When an organisation does not identify the need for training and development of their employees as an integral part of their sucess, employees skills tend to become obsolete leading to large scale lay-offs. A very good example of this scenario would be the IT industry. Apart from the changes in the political climate in USA, one of the main reasons for the large scale lay-offs in the IT industry and its future to hang in balance, was the failure to idenitfy the need for training and upgrading the skills of employees in a timely fashion. Hence, it is the duty of an organisation to identify this need and close the gap because an employee`s bright future would reflect in the sucess of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
