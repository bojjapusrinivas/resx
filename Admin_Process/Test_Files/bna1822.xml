Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"&gt;Medical care is considered to be very important necessity for citizens because the medical tests are to be done to the people inorder to know their health issues.&amp;nbsp;There is a famous saying "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="null bold"&gt;&lt;span class="null" style="font-family: times new roman,times;"&gt;Prevention is&amp;nbsp;better than cure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"&gt;". If &lt;span style="font-size: medium;"&gt;an individual doesn`t know about his/her health condition, he won`t be in a situation to prevent his/her disease. So, medical care is the basic necessity for citizens. Lets say there is a disease which can be spreaded easily from one person to another, and if the person is has no idea about his/her disease, they wont take any precaution and the disease will be spreaded to several other people which will lead a problem to the society. There was also a famous saying "Health is Wealth" which means that a person or an individual who is healthy is considered to be a wealthy person. The person who is rich with&amp;nbsp;many problems cannot lead his life happily he will be so busy in masking money and neglects his heath and at the end of the day he need to spend all his money in taking treatments,whereas a person who is poor or from a middle class family leads his life happily because they will take of their health. So the poor or the middle class person leads a wealth life when compared to a rich person. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: medium;"&gt;According to my perspective, Medical care should not be commercialized because, the people of under poverty line and the poor people cannot afford the prices of the medical tests. Lets consider an example - Swine flu. Currently in India, most of the people are suffering with swine flu and many of the people are not surviving. It is leading to the death of the people. So many hospitals started issuing vaccine for swine flu and they made it available in&amp;nbsp;every store so that the citizens can prevent themselves from that disease. But the cost of that vaccine is Rs. 700 which a normal person cannot afford it. The medical services should be available to each and every person to stay healthy and wealthy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: medium;"&gt;Now-a-days people are more&amp;nbsp;concerned about their health rather than their wealth. In a family, medical tests should be done to every member so that each person will take care of themselves and also their relatives or peer group. The person who is healthy should make every person happy. People believe that, the person who smiles daily will lead a healthy life because they wont get depressed of the un necessary things and the people who stay with him also lives happily. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: medium;"&gt;The medical services that are present, are easily available to SC and ST communities. But, the person who has no white card or any other proof, is not availing this opportunity. So government should take care of all these issues that were suffered by the low income people or by the disabled persons. I conclude that Medical care is the basic necessity for citizens and it should not be commercialized because low income people cannot avail those services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
