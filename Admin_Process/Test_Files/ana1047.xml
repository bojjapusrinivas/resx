<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/21/2014 10:40:38 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think that even with a population of over 1.2 billion, India has still not be able to produce entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India is the most populated country in the world.At the same time though the India is the wastly populated according my knowledge is all aspects. As we all know Bil Gates is the richest person in the world.Eventually according to our Indian basis there is no proper opportunity to get success.Indian people mindset will very high professional but there is no proper outstanding performance to perform in a high intellectual manner.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As per my thought being an Indian, where the India plays a prominent role in each and every aspect like example,living styles,highly professional,well educated,good communications skills,mind set,behaviour,etc..but the current scenario is the most tedious task to maintain.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Likewisw,where u.k and u.s are much more forward when compared our entrepreneurs,working to the u.s or u.k based companies projects or task is the most tedious task but being an Indian we prove it to do in a better easy way.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Being a part of Indian we are proud enough to prove ourself in each and every criteria.Even most the great person like BillGates willing to think a while about our great Indian proficiency.BillGates are eventually more scarred about Indian Intelligence.According to me my first thought is Indian&amp;#39;s can turnover at a great hights even we are indegatiable.we perform our task which was given by the company with a decent effort.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Likewise being an Indian we are a bit lazy but we do our professional task in a great way.we look forward for good oppurtunities were we can show our better.nothing is achieved without enthusiasam.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Working for the abroad based projects are the Indian projects that doesn&amp;#39;t matter being an Indian.our aim is maintain the companies moto.At the sane time we can gain our experience and growth.Likewise,the companies development and organization too.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There is&amp;nbsp;a great possibility that our Indians are&amp;nbsp;highly professional based and maintain the business management deals now a days.ofcourse,India has not&amp;nbsp;been able to produce entrepreneurs because of their own intelligence.I have best example,where our film actor &amp;quot;MuraliMohan&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;has a high business deals like real-estate business,few companys, and probably maintaing &amp;quot;Jayaberi gardens&amp;quot; from years ago.coming to our Minister&amp;quot; Lagadapaty&amp;quot; has a great&amp;nbsp; popular name of business management like &amp;quot;Lanco Hills&amp;quot; likewise there are many popular Indians who has bought up our Indian statergy in a high environments.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Therefore,there are many Indians who are trying to gain the right opportunity,but the thing is there are lacking behind of the better&amp;nbsp;oppurtunities.we being in Hyderabad,working for company is a straight forward deal to complete our task.But at the same time there are &amp;#39;n&amp;#39; number of people who are still waiting for the good vaccanices including me among them.As per my point of view,there are many people who really want to participate in each and every aspect.For example, there are many companies located in our Hyderabad and lot of vaccanies waiting to&amp;nbsp;hire the people..per day they are many people&amp;nbsp;who are&amp;nbsp;travelling&amp;nbsp;from Banglore to Hyderabad&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for a good company. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;people coming from different areas maintaing their own personality skills which plays a prominent role.Indian&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;have very high Intellectual standards in every scenario.working for a company as well as gaining some knowledge is also important. Were Indians are multi-talented,completing the following task in a great efforts is more prominent to.If I nominate to&amp;nbsp;any of the compoany&amp;nbsp;I really try to give my best were I can prove and stand myself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Finally, I want to conclude that India is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;best country and I&amp;nbsp; am proud to be an Indian.were I can do better in all aspects.so I say&amp;nbsp; that I can give a good output in a good manner were I can do my best.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
