Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per my opinion, Agriculture sector plays a very important role in driving the economic condition of the country. Around 70% of the national income comes from agriculture. Agriculture is a source which alone contributes alot in the development of the economy.&amp;nbsp;Mainly people residing in states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar pradesh, earns their livelihood through agriculture only. Government has also provided many subsidies to the farmers doing agriculture practices. They have established Regional Rural Banks, state corporations&amp;nbsp;etc. for granting loans and advances at a cheaper interest rates. To protect the interest of farmers from zamindar&amp;#39;s, they have also made several laws/Act&amp;#39;s. Many schemes have been launched to promote agriculture like NABARD etc. Many educational instituions have been opened for educating farmers and young blood in doing agricultural practices effectively and efficiently. Now a days even organic farming has also been started by farmers. Ex. Baba Ramdev&amp;#39;s patanjali products. Apart from subsidies, govt. has also provides farmers with other benefits like cheap electricity, free home appliances, lotteries etc. This all is being done just to increase the agriculture practices in the country so that the maximum economic benefits should be enjoyed for the development of the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In the recent Budget also, Government has mainly has mainly focused on the agriculture part. Many of our country&amp;#39;s agricultural products are been exported to different countries also, eg. rice to pakistan etc. and are being traded through world trade center. More exports will increase the foreign trade and foreign exchange in the country, which will again help in the growth and development of the economy. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Apart from Agriculture, service sector also plays an important role in the development of the country. Many multinational countries have established their business units in india providing employment to indian nationals. They helps in reducing the unemployment rate in the economy. Most of the service sector income comes from BPO&amp;#39;s (Business Process Outsourcing). Government has also approved 100% FDI(Foreign Direct Investment) in multibranding retailing and 51% in insurance. It will at end the help in controling inflation as products wil be available at low prices, and generate employment opportunities&amp;nbsp;also. Eg. Walmart, if walmart comes to india, it will benefit both the service sector and agriculture sector, as it will be providing job opportunities to indian people and using indian resources to the fullest and guiding farmers in doing a effective farming.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Agriculture and Service sector are the sectors which have a major contributionn the development of the economy, but these are not the only sectors, there are many sectors apart from these which also helps in development of the economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
