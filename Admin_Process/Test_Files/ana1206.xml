<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:32:59 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a days health care is preferred as&amp;nbsp;the most important aspect.As health&amp;nbsp;plays a&amp;nbsp;crucial role in each and every ones life health care should be given importance in every possible way.With good health comes the&amp;nbsp;wealth,fame&amp;nbsp;followed by&amp;nbsp;success.So one should never ignore about health issues.In our country health care is not being considered as the major aspect.Money is&amp;nbsp;playing&amp;nbsp;a vital role every&amp;nbsp;where.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Many people especially in India are facing problems not able to afford for the major health issues in the private hospitals.There are government hospitals which operate &amp;nbsp;people free of cost but the atmosphere of the hospitals are not up to the mark.There is no proper infrastructure, medical equipments in the hospitals.With the increase in population, people are suffering a lot as there are exposed more to the pollution which is leading to many health problems.Every now and then due to&amp;nbsp;climatic and weather&amp;nbsp;changes&amp;nbsp;people are suffering from fever,cold cough which can be easily spread to others which&amp;nbsp;increases more demand in the health care.This demand is being used for commercial purpose. This is completely wrong.The government should start&amp;nbsp; medical camps in every nook and corner not only in the rural areas but also in the urban areas.The doctors who who work in the government hospitals should serve all the patients whenever there is a need.The &amp;#39;&amp;#39;hypocratical oath&amp;#39;&amp;#39; taken by the doctors to serve every patient should be like a moral principal rather than taking it for granted. A doctor is like a god to the patient so the doctor should serve his best to save the patient from any health issue.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In order to improve patient&amp;nbsp;care the government of india should take the following steps&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;1. Ambulance service should be free of cost.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2.In case of emergency, helicopter should be provided for the patient because saving the patient is the utmost&amp;nbsp;objective.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;3.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Cancellation of licenses of &amp;nbsp;the doctors who are going against the rules and regulations like illegal scanning and wrong medical advices which may be dangerous to a patient.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;4.Government should provide health schemes to all the individuals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5.Every ambulance should be provided with all necessary medical equipments and a well qualified doctor.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;6.Government should not charge high fees to the students who aspire to become a doctor.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;7.The medical equipments should be updated with the change in technology.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;8.Any complaint from a patient should be taken seriously.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;9.Regular&amp;nbsp;evaluation on hospitals and clinics regarding the patient care&amp;nbsp;should be done by a health board.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;10. Government should set up hospitals at the major and also minor areas where it can be easily available to the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Workshops should be conducted everywhere&amp;nbsp;how&amp;nbsp;a person can help himself from an emergency health problem. The main goal of every hospital or any health care organisation&amp;nbsp;and the government&amp;nbsp;should be to save a life of a person in every possible way.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
