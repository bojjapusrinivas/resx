Do you think this brain drain is making the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer? Discuss the pros and cons of brain drain, and measures to check this phenomenon? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The countries which are already developed &amp;nbsp;that countries might be &amp;nbsp; rich countries, where they have good economic and growth &amp;nbsp;infrastructure,litreature corporate companies &amp;nbsp;in there own countries .The people who are qualified to do &amp;nbsp;work to devolpe &amp;nbsp;there own countries by economic, growth ,GDP,infrastructure ,profile and money. Japan ,United States of America,China&amp;nbsp;and United kingdom are developed countries and richest countries in the world ,this countries &amp;nbsp;are developed by there own country &amp;nbsp;people .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Japan and China are leading countries in &amp;nbsp;the world for manufacturing the products , &amp;nbsp;because they have good education &amp;nbsp;good technologyand economic &amp;nbsp;by using &amp;nbsp;there own ideas and &amp;nbsp;different technologies ,they produce different products into&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;market &amp;nbsp;day by day&amp;nbsp;to develope there &amp;nbsp;countries &amp;nbsp;economic and growth ,they try to be different with other countries,this two countries are developed and rich countries because of there manufacturing &amp;nbsp;and developing the technology by day by day.people working there own countries &amp;nbsp;wil get good position , &amp;nbsp;profile &amp;nbsp;and money .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;some countries like United States of America and United king dom are also developed countries as well as rich countries , but they wont manufacture the products as like as china and japan , this countries depends on &amp;nbsp;other countries like china and japan , where they need to work in othere countries to developed there own countries , they need to develope there work experience and work profile .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;some &amp;nbsp;small countries like &amp;nbsp;nepal bhutan &amp;nbsp;srilanka and some more asian countries, have to depend on othere countries , like usa and uk to develope there countries china &amp;nbsp;, where they wont be any infrastructure economic , growth and GDP.Some qualified people work in rich countries like usa and uk to work on the good profile and good positionto earn money . This people develope there neighbourhood countries not there own countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The previous growth of china was 7.7% .As per experts and research analysts said that &amp;nbsp;this time it may &amp;nbsp;increase &amp;nbsp;to 8-9 %,but governement of china is also saying that it wil increase upto only &amp;nbsp;7.5% ,which was less than a previous year . &amp;nbsp;li keqiang have given a speech in Germany saying that it may growth may increase upto 7% which was less than two previous years but slowly it wil increase the growth percent and doubles the GDP of the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Growth rate may fall down due to labour forces in china, but the combinations of having different sectors like indusralisation, technology,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;urbanization agriculture wil improve there growth rate as well as economy of the country .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Manufacuring the weak products and exporting to other countries this also e cause to slow down the growth rate of china.china faces some risk from &amp;nbsp;local government for having a debt .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China &amp;ndash; Economic Outlook for 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fast can China grow? That is the question underlying much of the discussion about China&amp;rsquo;s economy these days. Clearly, double digit growth is not in the cards and may even be a thing of the past. Growth of 7.7 percent in the first quarter was considered disappointing, and, until recently, many analysts were expecting growth to revert to the range of 8&amp;ndash;9 percent. Yet now the government appears determined to reset expectations. The government has forecast that growth this year will be 7.5 percent, a good deal lower than many private analysts had forecast only recently. That is certainly slower than the 7.8 percent growth in 2012, which was the slowest rate of growth in 13 years. Premier Li Keqiang, in a recent speech in Germany, said that growth for the remainder of the decade will average an even lower 7.0 percent per year. Although far slower than the growth experienced during the past two decades, Li indicated that China is &amp;ldquo;entering a range of reasonable growth.&amp;rdquo; Given that China has become a more mature economy with a declining labor force, Li is probably correct in setting more modest expectations. Moreover, growth of 7.0 percent is not bad: It doubles the GDP in 10 years. Li said that a combination of industrialization, urbanization, improvements in agricultural productivity, and investments in technology can contribute to healthy growth, and that this requires more market-oriented reforms. He also said that &amp;ldquo;for a very big economy, this is not easy.&amp;rdquo; When and how such reforms will be implemented remains uncertain. While some reforms have been announced, many government statements have been relatively vague. With a new regime just installed, it could take some time to build the support necessary to implement much needed reforms. In the interim, China faces some risks, including the ramifications of large local government debt, considerable leverage in the shadow banking system, and weaker-than expected manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing weakness stems from weakness in export markets. In addition, rising wages in China are having an adverse impact on export competitiveness, thereby leading to an exodus of manufacturing capacity. Thus, even growth in the range of 7&amp;ndash;8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further global integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves China&amp;rsquo;s economic relationship with the rest of the world. China&amp;rsquo;s government now says it will study the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP), an effort to create a free-trade area in the Pacific Basin. Currently there are 12 countries involved in this effort: the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. If China joins the group, the TPP will collectively account for more than half of global GDP. Freer trade would entail not simply lowering tariffs and quotas, although this would be an important component. It would also involve freeing up domestic markets so that they would have to compete freely with foreign companies. From China&amp;rsquo;s perspective, this could be a positive development in that it would create pressure to privatize state-run companies, create a level playing field for the private sector, and allow free movement of prices of goods and credit. Still, agreement on the TPP is probably a long way off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
