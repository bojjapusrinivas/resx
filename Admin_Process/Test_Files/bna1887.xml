List out and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The topic is about techological adavancements and what are the advantages and disadvantages for the advancements made in our daily life mainly work from homes.Technology is making the human life very easy to communicate ,Earn money,Facilities around us,Education system,Banking sector.India is a developing country because of this techonological advancements.In our day-day &amp;nbsp;life&amp;nbsp;techology has been changed widerly.I supporrt this advancement is become disadvantage .It is usefull only in some situation.people cannot gain more knowledge and interaction cannot be done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;As per &amp;nbsp;my view working from home is necessary in only some situations like if the people who are handycapped,housewifes,pregnents ladies,who stays regulary at home.These people can work from home.The people how are working from home doesnot have any contact with their collegues.In that situations &amp;nbsp;to clarify those mistakes it became a difficulty. We cannot gain knowlege and &amp;nbsp;our brains works only on one narrow path creativity cannot be developed.We cannot develop self respect and self image by working from home.If we work from office from word of mouth or by discussing with collegues we can gain more knowledge.By getting knowledge we can improve ourself.Brains thinks in a different way so that we can create something.Experience is really very important in life from this we can learn knowledge.This experience and knowledge cannot come easily by sitting in one place without taking insights from other.Even insights can be given by our friends or family members that does not become any useful because,Company is a place were different kinds of knowledge is place in one area.EG:In a company there are different strings like finance,marketing,production,manufacturing.procurement,warehousing all he departments are involved here so by doing work from home we could not get any basic idea from all these departments.Working from home cannot create professionalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Advantages:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1.There will be no work tension.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;5.Those who are interested to gain money thiis is the easy method to gain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;6.In case of government holidays on that day we have one advantage to work from home.This is very helpfull in difficulty situations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1.we cannot gain more knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2.The proffesinal appearence will not be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013AutoIndustryOutlookfortheUSandEurope&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This topic is about Auto industry outlook for U.S and Europe.U.S is one of the developed country in the world the people in U.S change according to the techological changes and Each and every people &amp;nbsp;are educated so all follows stricts rules and regulationsAs per the rule in U.S the vechicles should not be used if tyhe vechicle falls under aging.Due to that the people regularly sell and recycle their cars so this is one of the benfits for the automobiles to sell the cars in US and also the bankers also gives loans with mower interest rates.These all makes auto industry to recover and more sales in U.S.The old &amp;nbsp;vechicles in 2012 were around 10.8 and its was increased to 11.3 in 2013.The increase &amp;nbsp;was around &amp;nbsp;0.5.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 - Auto Industry Outlook for the US and Europe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;U.S. Market Recovery &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Strong pent-up demand due to aging vehicles on the U.S. roads along with falling unemployment rate have been the key factors in driving the auto sales in the U.S. Average age of vehicles on U.S. roads increased to 11.3 years in January 2013 from 10.8 years in 2012. Banks were also friendlier as they offered greater access to loans with lower interest rates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% to the five-year high of 14.5 million vehicles in 2012. In May 2013, auto sales in the U.S. grew 8.2% to 1.44 million units while it rose 10.9% to 15.3 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted rate (SAAR) basis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Economic Crisis in Europe &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The present Eurozone financial crisis has adversely affected the operations of many global automakers, especially GM and Ford, who have a significant exposure to the market. Car sales in Europe continued to be low owing to weak consumer confidence on the back of a weak economy triggered by the crisis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;According to the European Automobile Manufacturers` Association (ACEA), car sales in Europe reached its lowest level of 12.05 million units in 2012 since 1995, indicating a year-over-year decline of 8.2% due to the sagging demand for cars, as highly indebted banks were reluctant to finance new car purchases for customers. The decline was the steepest in the highly troubled Eurozone, where car sales dipped 11.3% to roughly 9 million units, according to Reuters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Most of the major automakers in Europe are resorting to job cuts and plant closures, as it became no longer feasible for them to undertake full-fledged operations in the continent. Unemployment in the EU reached 26.5 million in Mar 2013, while the unemployment rate increased to 10.9% in the same month from 10.3% in Mar 2012. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the U.S. automakers, Ford plans to shut vehicle and component plants in the U.K. and Belgium in the next two years while General Motors would suspend car production at its Bochum plant in Germany -- which employs 3,100 workers -- in 2016. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the European automakers, Renault plans to retrench 7,500 jobs in France by 2016 while each of Fiat and Peugeot has decided to eliminate 1,500 jobs. Among the Japanese automakers, Honda announced plans to terminate 800 jobs at its South Marston plant near Swindon, southwest England in the second quarter of 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
