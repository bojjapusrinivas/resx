Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Health is most important for any human being on this earth. There is a famous saying which gives the meaning&amp;nbsp;health is much more important than wealth. If a person is healthy he can earn money by many ways but if he is not healthy he could not earn any thing. For a person to be healthy&amp;nbsp;there are many medical services now a days provided in the society. Medical care is one of the area which is growing is faster pace. Medical care is improving as lot many viruses are increasing. These medical services must be rendered to all the citizens. Commercialization of&amp;nbsp; the medical services is necessary in order to avail all the medical benefits to every part of the world. Every medical service need&amp;nbsp; to be commercialized as without medical services we cannot survive. If every thing was commercialized there are lot many people who could avail them. People must concern about others health also. Hospitals now a days are taking a different route by treating every medical issue under one roof this is a good way so that the patient need not move to any other hospital for different problem.&amp;nbsp; Medical equipment manufacturing companies also focusing on designing the machines which can be conveniently used by patients and designing according to patients needs which is a good way to know that they serve the patient views.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;People who are educated must also take an opportunity to educate about the medical benefits they could avail from the government.&amp;nbsp;Definitely we would&amp;nbsp;not be better if the medical services are not commercialized. commercialization of&amp;nbsp;medical services may increase the cost we are spending on particular service but the quality of service which we are offered will be obviously better.&amp;nbsp;Here as an example we can consider the Government hospitals vs. Private hospitals. In government hospitals we were charged less but the quality of medical service they provide is less compared to private hospitals. Medial services in India is increasing and we can see a lot more news about the major critical&amp;nbsp;operations which were done successfully by our doctors. Many medical equipment manufacturing companies from other countries are establishing their plants in India due to increased medical services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;citizens of any particular country must concern about other health also this does not mean they have to take care of every person but by following minimum things like keeping their surroundings clean throwing the waste in dustbins. Because now a days there are many health problems which are caused due to lack of cleanliness. Campaigns must me conducted by governments and also institutes in rural areas in order to educate people their about the medical issues where the medical services will be rendered to solve a particular medical problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Thus commercialization of medical services will improve the quality of services provided and also it will reach maximum number of people through promotions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
