Do you think the Bill can help protect people against poverty and insecurity?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As a living being on earth we are entitled to consume food for our life. Mother nature has provided variety of sources through which we can fulfil our&amp;nbsp;basic need&amp;nbsp;of food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Earlier the humans were free to utilize the edible things according to their choice , but as the revolution introduced in our society , we started being dependent on higher authority. Previously King was responsible to manage this kind of duties for society welfare.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Later on , basically after independence the concept of &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Government&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; was introduced. Till now this trend is going on .&amp;nbsp;Now a days we are completely dependent on policies given by Govt. . Every aspect of our life is directly or indirectly is influenced by the Govt.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Budgets, bills, tax ,&amp;nbsp;import , export etc. ,&amp;nbsp;so many things are there which are directly controlled by the Govt..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So the power of whole nation is in the hand of Govt. of India . Like two sides of a coin , there are&amp;nbsp; some pros and cons of this power. In India the main cons is the politics of votes. Our maximum politicians are only concerned with their positions only . We can see so many advertisement on T.V at the time of elections, which shows many promises made by politicians ,but in real they are just a rosy picture.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#39;Food Security Bill&amp;#39;&lt;/strong&gt; is one of them. In our country the ratio of rich and poor population is imbalanced.&lt;br /&gt;There is a big gap between the two , and within this gap middle class is present. Thus we have huge amount of poor and middle class people , so it is clearly visible that they are the big vote bank for politicians. &lt;br /&gt;The high class people are hardly concerned about the price hikes of commodities , as they have enough money to spend . &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;On the other side the poor and middle class&amp;nbsp;are very much influenced by this price variation , as there&amp;nbsp; amount for spending&amp;nbsp;is very limited , even sometime they survive&amp;nbsp;by having&amp;nbsp;one time meal. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;By announcing this type of Bills the Govt.&amp;nbsp; wants to attract the attention of&amp;nbsp;people towards them.&lt;br /&gt;Reality is entirely different. There are so many mandatory formalities ,which you are supposed to complete to utilize this&amp;nbsp;facility. In fact , still there are so many people&amp;nbsp;who are struggling for&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#39;Rashan Card&amp;#39;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;One reality show on&amp;nbsp;T.V , has broadcast one story&amp;nbsp;of the sexual harassment of girl by one politician ,who&amp;nbsp;wanted to get Rashan Card for her family living.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So now , how can we say that we should &amp;nbsp;feel secure by having such kind of bills. There are so many traders who make money by using&amp;nbsp;these facilities of&amp;nbsp;Govt . ,because we are not directly connected with&amp;nbsp;Govt., a long channel is exist between us, and this channel is&amp;nbsp;filled with corrupt people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Although the &amp;#39;Right of Information Act&amp;#39; is present in our constitution , but most of the poor people are illiterate, who are hardly&amp;nbsp;aware about their rights. Govt. feels that that people are utilizing the&amp;nbsp;advantage of bills passed by them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So I think that there is no&amp;nbsp;way to protect people form poverty and insecurity, by defining bills.&amp;nbsp;Our Govt. have to follow the strict guidelines, they have create proper channels and develop certain departments&amp;nbsp;who will be responsible to conduct the security&amp;nbsp;of people&amp;nbsp;and will work for prevention of poverty. They will&amp;nbsp;report directly to the Govt. about their work .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If&amp;nbsp;our Govt. develop such environment, we will be able to live like earlier with no dependency of such bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
