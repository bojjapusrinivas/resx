<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:32:37 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The government should take the following steps to overcome the gap that is prevailing in the country:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Inorder to improve the patients care they need to improve the process of medication by incresing the intensive care units. ICU&amp;#39;s must be well equiped.As many of the hospitals now-a-days are having ICU&amp;#39;s but they don&amp;#39;t have right equipment in their hospitals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The government must improve the ambulence facility i.e., it should have all the emergency equipments and medicines within the ambulence. In some areas when an accident&amp;nbsp;occurs and when&amp;nbsp;the ambulence is&amp;nbsp;called, we don&amp;#39;t get proper response and sometimes takes a lot of time to reach&amp;nbsp; particular destination. So, the government should take proper care in&amp;nbsp;maintaing ambulences.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government is proving medicines to the poor people but they are not delivered to the peoplein the right time. so, it should monitor whether they are being delivered in the right time and right way. And instead of giving the medicines to the patients,some hospitals&amp;nbsp;are selling the medicines outside for making money.So, the government should monitor the hospitals management.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Strict rules&amp;nbsp;and regulations must be given to the hospitals inorder to improve the health care. If the hospitals restrict to follow the rules, government should take strict actions on the hospitals so that they function in a proper way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Many hospitals do not have proper water supply. So, government must provide 24 hours water supply to the hospitals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Many of the doctors pay the fees and do their doctrate. the government should ban the payment seats because doctors play&amp;nbsp;a major role in saving our lifes. If suppose,&amp;nbsp;a person&amp;nbsp;who makes payment and becomes a doctor and does&amp;#39;nt have proper knowledge and if he starts giving treatment the patients life may be in danger. I does&amp;#39;nt say that all the people who are paying money are not giving proper treatment but their are few doctors who doesnt have proper knowledge. so, the government should take proper actions for this.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government must also take&amp;nbsp;care of monitoring the cleanliness, gardening and surroundings of the hospitals. If the surroundings are neat and clean, it leads to half treatment .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Govenrnment must keep a rule that the hospitals surroundings must have trees so that fresh air prevails and the diseases can be cured easily. It requires more space for planting trees, but by planting trees diseases can be cured in a short span of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More improvised equipment must be provided to the hospitals by the government so that better service can be offered to the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these are all the steps which are to be taken care by the government inorder to improve the health care in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
