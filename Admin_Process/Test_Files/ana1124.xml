What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I totally agree with the concept!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Compaired to the western countries ,in&amp;nbsp;India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand.There are many resaons behind this fact!Though India&amp;nbsp;holds &amp;nbsp;the second place in the worlds largest populated countries ,there are many factors that are left apart and not being taken care-off by the government of India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;There is a well known saying ,&amp;quot;health is wealth&amp;quot;!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Now a days in this compitetive world, people are working very hard to earn money in all the possible ways.&amp;nbsp;In their day to day and busy schedules they are actually forgetting ,to care of their health and are being prone to may diseases.Compared to the previous years, there are many diseases that are being identified and unidentified&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;among people across all age groups.Doctors,who are unable to identify these diseases are just offering the first grade of treatment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India, the availability of the goods &amp;amp; services has become very costly.Corruption is the other factor because of which the basic services offered to a common man has become very much cost effective.Compaired to the western countries , the healthcare supply offered to a common man in India is very unefficent.The reasons behind senario are;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Availability of the goods -75%of the quality goods&amp;nbsp;that are cultivated in India ,are exported to the abroad countires for trade purposes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*Lack of funds provided by the governemnt.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*Corruption-which has become the main source of income for many of the government agencies and employees.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*Low salaries.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*Unemployement .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*Lack of hospitals&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*Lack of Education.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*Religional beliefs ..etc..,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;all these reasons&amp;nbsp;are contributing to raise&amp;nbsp;a tremoundus gap between the healthcare and supply in India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;To overcome these drawbacks, the government of India should come up with&amp;nbsp;new policies and acts,which would satisfy the health care needs of the country.The primary steps that government of India should try to implement are,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*The services that are offered at the superspeciality hospitals should also be provided by the &amp;nbsp;government hospitals.(the hospital should be very much Hygienic,&amp;nbsp;concerned doctors should be available all the time,&amp;nbsp;proper care must be taken&amp;nbsp;for the emergency cases , there should be a medical store maintained by the hospitals which should keep the timely&amp;nbsp;stock of the medicines prescribed by the doctors, etc.)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*Cost of the services &amp;amp; treatments&amp;nbsp;should be minimum.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*The government should encourage the establishment of mutiple drug stores in the cities,towns &amp;amp; villages.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Programs like free medical camps,medical checkups,creating awareness about the diseases and cure should among the people in the villages ,towns and rural areas should be encouraged.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Government should provide better career growth &amp;amp; services&amp;nbsp;for the people (doctors, employees working at health agencies), so that they will not go abroad expecting a better life.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Corruption should be taken care of.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*Multiple hospitals with super speciality services should be opened across all the rural, urban areas&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* The governemt should minimize the rate of export of the quality goods.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If all these factors and the steps are properly implemented by the government and if they are properly taken care,the gap between the healthcare supply and demand in India &amp;nbsp;will be reduced a lot.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It becomes the duty of every Indian to try to follow these steps to lead a wonderful life ahead!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
