What do you think are the major steps that can be taken in present circumstances to push growth in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Indian economy is an economy that is being followed based on the articles framed in constitution and the type of government adopted i.e. Democracy, and is a mixture of several other countries policies that could help India to come into a&amp;nbsp;phase of&amp;nbsp;developed country from a phase of developing country. The Indian government&amp;nbsp;has framed many&amp;nbsp;policies n brought in many bills in order to&amp;nbsp;fight the rising inflation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Inflation is a very serious topic considered by every government be it of any country. Because it plays a key role in framing new policies and bringing in budgets for a financial year and the way market changes on a day-to-day basis, it becomes very important to analyse the situations and financial growth of any economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Inflation- is basically the shift in prices of various commodities, goods and services when its demand changes from time-to-time in the market.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Indian economy needs a revival for its better functioning and growth of the country. The population of the country and the ever-changing demands from the public needs to be considered by every business entity so that accordingly they can produce the goods and services and satisfy the customers. Also the government should see that the basic minimum needs of food, clothing, shelter of a common man are being fulfilled or not. And if not they should effective measures and come forward by various alternatives to satisfy the needs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I think the major steps like-the import-export duties and related policies should be reviewed, a positive correlation between the supply and demand should be maintained and balanced as well, the measures to control the over-growing population should be taken and related aspects of the financial status and the demographies of the population should be considered. These might help to push the growth of the Indian economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
