&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;India has a sub tropical Climate. It has four regions North, South, East and West and the climatic condition of all the regional zone&amp;nbsp;varies respectively.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The Norther Part are the coldest region of India where the tempereture fluctuation is mostly seen and lots of the devastation takes place over there. The reason &amp;nbsp;towards the climatic condition is Global Warming which has led to the ozone layer depletion. The Southen and the Eastern region falls in the mediteranean region with a moderate cliamte. The Western and the southern east region is being surrounded by Arabian Sea &amp;amp; Bay of Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, the foremost current policy framework towards combating the climate change is to be ecofriendly with the environment. Various scientist from ISRO, DRDO, COO&amp;nbsp;are working collaborately and looking forward towards maintaining the proper climatic condition. The climatic and weather forecasting intelligence are trying to make the people aware about the natural hazards through workshop, conferences, scientific meeting, news and so on. The Indian climate is forecasted to show a devastating change in the nearby future. Hence proper&amp;nbsp;initiatives must be taken inorder to protect our mother nature and also the lives of the innocent people who&amp;nbsp;are the victims of these hazards. Our Environmental Minister Mr. Prakash V and Welfare Minisiter Sushma Swaraj together with our Prime Minister who has much concerns towards the climatic condition of India implemented few&amp;nbsp;regulations after discussing with the scientist working on climatic and weather intelligence. Few of the Initiatives are as follows: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swach Bharat, an action started most recently being forwarded by our Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plantaion of more trees as a part of maintiaining ecofriendly environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage of Biodegradble products &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ban on the usage of vehicles generating more smoke&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage of LPG has been started in some parts of India&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awareness Programs through&amp;nbsp;workshop, conferences and so on across all the parts of India (Developed &amp;amp; Under developed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage of Ecofriendly electronic products&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;These are the measures being taken for combating climatic change in India. The climatic condition plays an important criteria to maintain a healthy ecofriendly environment with our Mother Earth. The natural calamities&amp;nbsp;like cyclones, floods, earthquake, melting of glaciers are all the results of our input. The increase in the release of CFC and other harmful gases has resulted towards the depletion of ozone layer; &amp;nbsp;a safety layer present between the atmosphere and&amp;nbsp;stratosphere absorbing&amp;nbsp;the ultra violet light and the harmful rays penetrating the earth. Hudhud, the most recent cyclone which generated in the Arabian sea due to the aquatic imbalance has showed its devastaing effects across the southern and few parts of the eastern region. &amp;nbsp;According to a recent news published by NASA, it has been found the rotaion period of the earth has been increased by 48 seconds. Researchers are finding out the reasons and the consequence of it. The inititors and the suffereres of this adhoc are the commoners itself. &amp;nbsp;Hence we should take an inititaive by ourself and make other follow the same&amp;nbsp;in reducing the&amp;nbsp;environmental hazards. Hence we can move forward with the common Slogan by Idea "Padhega India, To Badega India" i.e. Increasing literacy among &amp;nbsp;the people to make the people aware about the action they takes. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
