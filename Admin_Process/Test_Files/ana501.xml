What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that living in Big Cities offer much better benefits in comparison to rural areas, though rural areas&amp;nbsp;cannot be neglected altogether.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Firstly,&amp;nbsp;urban areas&amp;nbsp;offer schools and colleges that cater to good education, unlike rural areas where concern for good education is not shown. If we visit rural government schools of India, the pitiable situation&amp;nbsp;will be obvious.&amp;nbsp;On the other hand,&amp;nbsp;schools in cities feel so much responsible to make the child&amp;nbsp;understand and assimilate the subject. They also cater to the&amp;nbsp;their&amp;nbsp;overall development in terms of arts, sports, etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Secondly, health care&amp;nbsp;has become quickly available in urban areas. Medication and ambulances are&amp;nbsp; readily available in urban areas. Even at an unexpected accident, one can quickly reach to the nearby hospital.&amp;nbsp;But it is the sorry state of villages that even today, medicines for even small ailments&amp;nbsp;are not readily available what to speak of an unexpected accident. And government transportation facilities like RTC are scarcely available that their commuting to urban areas in some precarious situations is entirely dependent on personal vehicles, which most of the rural people would not possess.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Ofcourse rural areas are the core substance of a country for catering our&amp;nbsp;food needs in terms of vegetables, fruits, milk, grains, etc. But owing to poor conditions of rural areas, people migrate to cities. As a result, agriculture which is so essential for sustenance is neglected, which would have a deeper impact on the society,&amp;nbsp;as days progress. So a question arises as to how to reduce the disparity between urban and rural areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;A major role has to be played by Government in ensuring that migration be stopped for overall development of the state and country. One of the good schemes that has been implemented recently is 108 facility. Due to this, quick action at untoward situations&amp;nbsp;can be taken care of. In similar lines villages has to be acquainted with sufficient medications and health centres&amp;nbsp;in an organized&amp;nbsp;way. Strict&amp;nbsp;disciplinary actions has to be taken on doctors who&amp;nbsp;avoid their duties in primary health centres.&amp;nbsp;For education,&amp;nbsp;government has to ensure proper facilites and qualified teachers. Regular monitoring of students abilites and appropriate measures for improving the standards has to be taken. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Thus, in conclusion, i feel its completely in government&amp;#39;s hands which could reduce this disparity between urban and rural areas and thus cause overall growth of the society.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
