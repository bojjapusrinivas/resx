<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:32:26 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In India health&amp;nbsp;care plays a prominent role. It occupies a mojor sector. India is a developing country where there is much lack of health services. There are many reasons for this.&amp;nbsp;They might be social, economical, political, technical, etc. There are many poor people whom the health service is not available. There is much demand for health care services in India. But the supply is not much compared to the&amp;nbsp;demand.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are many well educated persons in India who can serve here for the poor. But they go abroad so that they can earn more. Only few people think of their country and serve for their country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The economic position of India is not stable. It may raises some times and may falls. The health care services can be supplied when there are proper funds&amp;nbsp;with government. But when the value of rupee has fallen down the demand increased like anything and supply decreased. When there are proper funds the government can provide good facilities for the patients. The supply&amp;nbsp; of facilities in India is less. Here comes the political reasons also. The ecomical and political reasons affects alot for the development of a country.&amp;nbsp;The funds provided by the government for the health care services are eaten by many of politicians. In India it is more. Serious actions should be taken by the government to avoid these kind of misleadings. The people who are doing these type of illegal actions should be punished very seriously so that the services provided for the patients can be improved.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There are many government hospitals which are providing good services now-a-days. But the doctors are not available in that hospitals. They just arrive the hospital once and go to private hospitals to earn more money. For them money matters alot than their service to the patients. Many poor&amp;nbsp;patients had died due to lack of doctors in government hospitals. And also the facilities provided are misguided by other people. This is the reason for the lack of supply of health care service for the people in India. The government funds are largely misguided by many people in the society. There are many incidents where patients died due to lack of medicines. But still the government is not responding much for these causes. The silence of&amp;nbsp;government makes people do their illegal activities without any fear. Once the government takes serious steps then the people afraid of doing such activities. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The government should allot health care services to hospitals for the patients.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It should strictly punish the one who misleads the government funds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It should provide the required technical&amp;nbsp;services&amp;nbsp;and medicines which are not outdated. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It should provide good and skillful doctors.&amp;nbsp;Out of 1000 people there is only one or two doctors available in many places in India. There is very much lack of doctors. So the government should mainly focus on providing doctors in India. Some of these actions may improve patient care in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
