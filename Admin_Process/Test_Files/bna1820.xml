Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Medical care is a basic necessity of citizens, yes it is the basic necessity of citizens. But people are mostly concerned about their well being and not that of the others this is partially true. Because untill and unless one takes care of self health he/she can take care of others too. If we look into different situations like a teacher and a student, teacher could be able to teach his/her students only when he/she is self tought or learn more. In the same way if one has to be concerned about the others well being one should be more concerned about their well being. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;If we take Indian senario&amp;nbsp;there are many yoga gurus who teach people about the importance and benifits through yoga.&amp;nbsp;They&amp;nbsp;able to teach and spread the importance of health by practicing yooga because they have learnt&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;are enjoying the benifits of it. One can not be poked always to take care&amp;nbsp;of his own health, the individual should know about&amp;nbsp;the inporatnce of health. There is a saying " An apple a day keeps doctor away",such a beautiful message given about the health in this sentence, that if we want to be healthy and active without taking any&amp;nbsp; kind of medicine which may cause&amp;nbsp; side effects to one`s health then the individual should eat an apple every which improves heamoglobin, antioxidants etc., in the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;But in many countries the peolpe of below poverty line who suffer the most with their health.There were practices in our country, the people who were rich enough would have servants and maids to take care of every individual in the house(about the breakfast,lunch, dinner etc). These servants or maids were paid less and the food they were offered was the food which was left out the before, in such times the Jamindhars( rich people) were not concerned about the&amp;nbsp; health of&amp;nbsp;the one who was serving them.In this situation the people are more concerned&amp;nbsp;abot their own well being.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;If we&amp;nbsp;look at the health care sectors in India the doctors are more but where as in countries like United states there&amp;nbsp;is one doctor per one thousand&amp;nbsp;citizen, the people of our country do not visit doctor for their regular checkup because we are not a developed country.&amp;nbsp;There is no awarness about the medical care&amp;nbsp;especially in rural area`s,if there are 50000 people in one village there will be one hospital with one doctor for&amp;nbsp;villages with such huge population and they are not concerned about the type of treatment they give to the patient.If a patient visits doctor with fever,&amp;nbsp;doctor writes some tablets which are related to malaria on prescription without checking the patient properly.The medical services reaching evry part of the country are very less we can say maximum of 40% of medical service is properly put in practice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Let us take an other situation, the government has passed a rule about the health plan in every school 2012&amp;nbsp;but the schools which follow this are only about 5 to 10% in our country. In this situation the&amp;nbsp;government should commercialize the medical&amp;nbsp;services in each and every sector stating from schools to&amp;nbsp;the corporates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Recently many people&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Hyderabad suffered from swineflue but the medical service offered to them is not faster, the neccesary precautions were not taken over the treatment or the service offered to patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Therefore&amp;nbsp;I conclude that there is neccessity&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp; commmertialize the medical services and we are not better off with it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
