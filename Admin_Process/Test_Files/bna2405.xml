&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Bullet train or better train- " India need a better bullet train"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; As the name suggets bullet train, it is very fast in speed. we can reach the destination in less time when compared to the normal speed train. at present generation the time saving is more important. India is developing country and we are using normal speed trains. Germany,japan, south korea and some other developed countries are using bullet trains so that the time can be saved and work can be finished as per the stipulated time. We, Indians started using bullet trains in some metropolitan cities. it has many advantages and disdavantages. coming to the advantages, it is very fast in speed and can save the time. The saved time can be used for any other work. where as the disadvnatages are, as they are moving very fast. there is a chance of risk to the life. if the condition of the train and moving place are good then there is no problem otherwise it is a risk to the life. the working condition should be checked before running the train. the countries who are using bullet train should have a good software(Technology)and proper observation for a safe life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;As a good line says that, speed thrills but kills. more speed may be dangerous to the life but if proper observation and care is taken. the speed may also help in getting our work done more fast. if speed and security to the life( while travelling )goes hand in hand then it is more adavantageous. as both are working correctly, the bullet trains are recommended and are using in developed countries. if this kind of rule is followed in any developing countries the bullet trains can be suggestable. more carefullness is required in working with bullet trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Coming to the better trains, as the name suggests better trains, it is good in service and goes with required speed(not with the slow speed or not like bullet train). most of the developing countries are using better trains. as a proverb says, slow and steady wins the race. the speed of the train may not be like bullet train but it reaches the destination safetly. life of the human being is more important than the saved time to do the work. more technology is required for bullet trains and citizens in the country must be educated to understand the functionality of the bullet train.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;so if any country want to use the bullet train. it must be capable of using high technology and should consists of &amp;nbsp;more educated citizens. the main reason in the success of bullet trains in any developed countries is the usage of technology and people living in the cities. the government also plays an important role in developing a country. presently in India also, the bullet trains are working in few cities. the people in india are well educated when compared to the last few years. &amp;nbsp;the recent government took an intiation in using high technology bullet trains. the developed countries are using advanced technology to improve their growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;bullet as well as better train have their own advantages. it depends on the usage of the technology. there are few countries, which are using better trains but there are still some accidents. so it depends on the country usage of the technology. if better trains are not properly worked in the country how can they handle bullet train. the general awareness among the citizens is important. the government should take neccessary steps to make aware of the technology and its utilization. developing countries should concentrate mainly on the education. if more citizens in the country are educated the usage of technology can be known.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;India is a such a country which has both better and bullet trains. in metropolitian cities bullets are used and in few areas the better trains are running. india is having both educated and un-educated citizens. india is a developing country. so if proper care is taken by the government by eradicating illiteracy. more bullet trains will come to the country. " india need a better bullet train". It will happen very soon. india is good at technology and citizens living will soon welcome the bullet train. &amp;nbsp;the economic growth of india is very high when compared to our neighbouring countries. so the better bullet can be expected very soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;the arrangement of bullet train requires money and land. there is a plenty of land or good area for running train and second one is money. the economic condition of india is good when compare to the last few years. india is becoming more digital. the present government is taking appropraite decisions in improving the country. indian railway has one of the biggest railway system in history. railways in india are changing its infrastructure in order to look better. indian railways are in competition with other developing countries. indian railways are included in budget because it is generating more revenue to the government. the government is also taking neccessary steps in improving railway system and seperate budget is allocated for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;as india is towards globalisation.it will soon start using better bullet trains for better growth of the country and will become one of the developed country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
