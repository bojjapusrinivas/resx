&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;better trains can help the citizens to reach their designations on time,feel secure to use the services again,to feel comfortable to travel again.the trains should &amp;nbsp;maintain cleanliness and also provide with good sanitation,the food thats provided in the train must be hygenic.better trains means making the existing trains to function properly like it &amp;nbsp;should be on time,a correct schedule should be maintained.as the population of the country is increasing it would be good if the government try to add few more trains so that the passengers can travel at a ease.when we look at the local trains in india we can find various peoples at the doors where it can lead to increase in the accidents.every train must have a doctor in it because in case of emergency we might need them.the stations should also be clean and with a hygene food stalls .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;bullet trains are the trains which run at a higher speed than the usual trains.in india their is a bullet train at delhi where it is helping the people to travel in fraction of seconds.bullet trains help the people to lessen the time that is taken for their travel.in an average it tries to cover around more than 70km/hr.these bullet trains can be helpful for the people who travel to different cities within &amp;nbsp;the same state for their jobs.it would help people to reach in time and reach home safely.if these trains are introduced in every metro citiy then these will aslo lessen the accidents and also the rush that in seen in the trains and the stations.as bullet trains less time to complete the journey it can take upto 20 rounds per day which can help the people to travel quickly.bullet trains can be built at high level from earth or underground where it can lessen the pollution.in india we still have trains which run on coal which cause air pollution.so these trains can also help in lessening the pollution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;in foreign countries the use of bullet trains is already in practices where we can find that the accidents are less and also the passengers are very happy with the services of their trains.the train their rarely gets late in time,its hardly for about &amp;nbsp;3 to 5 minutes where the trains might get late for which the driver needs to give explanation to his passengers at japan.where as when we come to india,the trains are usually late with a mininum of half an hour.the authorities should also sometimes visit the foreign countries to know the way they operate all the operations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;the citizens must be given &amp;nbsp;instructions to use the trains as it might help them when something happens in the train.also the station masters must take all the precautions in case of any emergency.we need both the services because the needs of the people differ from people to people.it depends upon the people that what kind of services they want to use so as a passenger i would like if both the trains are available to me.better trains can help in better servicesand can be used for long journeys &amp;nbsp;and bullet trains can help the passengers to &amp;nbsp;travel daily to their workplaces or schools or colleges.if better trains are brought up then it would help the government to increase its revenue and also to get a good name in various fields like best services,best clean city etc titles can also be received.when the services are good the people automatically tend to take the services which provide comfort to them.it would be good if a higher authority person travels as a normal person in train where he himself can understand all the burdens that are faced by the passengers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
