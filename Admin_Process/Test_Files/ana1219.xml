<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:43:40 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At&amp;nbsp;present in India, we can find many Healthcare Hospitals but most are the Privatized Hospitals. Due to increase in demand for the healthcare the cost of services has been&amp;nbsp;increased drastically. When compared to Private Hospitals, Government Hospitals are less in number and the fee paid for their services is also too high.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Today we can find many diseases, which are caused due to &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Natural change in Environment,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Experiments made on Animals and Human,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* New gases are being released in the environment by Factories,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Pollution such as Noise pollution, Sound pollution and&amp;nbsp;Water pollution.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;They are also many disadvantages for which directly or indirectly Government is responsible.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* The first reason which I would mention is Corruption. In the past 10years there is an enormous increase in corruption in Private as well as Government Hospitals by which proper care is not being provided to the poor people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* In India, coming to villages most of the people are uneducated and are unaware about new diseases which have already entered.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Cost of education on Healthcare has increased by which poor and moderate families cannot effort such a costly education for their children though they have interest in making so. So there is a lack of doctors in India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*&amp;nbsp;Recently Foreign countries have stopped importing the goods from India because chemicals are being used in fertilizers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Steps to be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Proper Education should be provided for the students who are interested in&amp;nbsp;Healthcare and Scholarship should be provided to the students.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Villagers should be made aware by&amp;nbsp;situating campaigns at their place.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Natural treatment should be made aware as in the ancient period and motivating the people to adopt them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Recently an organisation&amp;nbsp;has started which is providing the medicines at less cost manufactured by them. Such organisations should come forward and situate their branches across the world.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*Natural methods should be adopted for production of goods&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;By applying the above steps, the gap between the supply &amp;amp; demand can be reduced to some extent and proper care can be taken by the Healthcare organisations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
