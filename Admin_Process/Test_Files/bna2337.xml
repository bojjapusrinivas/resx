<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;11/23/2016 11:05:23 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss the pros and cons of the Indian Government&amp;rsquo;s action plan for demonetization of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes. What would be the long term impact of this step on terror financing and creation of unaccounted wealth?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The year 2016 is historically a game-changing year for India. With the decision taken by the Government to demonitize Rs.1000/- and Rs.500/- notes, India is moving towards becoming a transparent &amp;nbsp;and fair economy. However, this stand-alone step would not be beneficial unless it is backed up by other measures to support the cause. The decision has its own advantages and disadvantages that need to be regarded to understand the long-term implications of it for the nation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The country has witnessed prodigious advancements in technology and acceleration of various industries. Despite the phenomenal increase in penetration of internet usage in the country, the government fails to digitalize payments and facilitate fintech ecosystems. While the decision to demonitize currency notes brings light upon the unaccounted money present in the country, it also proves the advanced systems the country fails to incorporate. The obvious advantageous &amp;nbsp;impact of this decision is the elimination of unaccounted wealth as the bearer of such can no longer claim the notes with no monetary value without a proven income track-record. Finances being fully accounted can facilitate the government`s aims to digitalise payments. Futhermore, a currency bill has the governor`s assurity to pay a sum of money to the bearer. The elimination of the `excess` unaccounted notes removes the liability of the governor to pay the sum of money to the bearer. In the long-run, this can decrease the liabilities of the country. The country can anticipate a significant decrease in the prices of all commodities, which the country is already witnessing. for example, the prices of pulses dropped to nearly half of its prevailing rates. Demonitization of Rs,500/- and Rs.1000/- currency notes has seized hoarding and ill-practices of middlemen in the country, thereby reducing prices. At an individual level, citizens of the country will become more alert while filing their incomes with the government and avoid malpractices and building unaccounted wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;On the business forefront, the increase in cash-less payments and digital systems can give rise to various entrepreneurial opportunities in the country and further accelerate the economy. India could be one of the first countries to efficiently incorporate the revolutionary blockchain technology for banking and payments on a large-scale. Blockchain technology enables cash-less transfers of money across the globe without the need of smart gadgets and active internet connections. This implies that people living in unequipped villages would also be able to go cash-less. Politically speaking, the income payback to the government by the individuals in terms of taxes would be channelized to the right uses to exponentially progress the development of the nation and put and end to corruption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The long-term benefits of this decision are constantly being communicated to the public. However, the downsides are practically faced by these individuals and the backhand support(Banks, ATMs etc.). Inconvience caused to business persons, individuals and banks for their fundamental functioning is only regarded as a temporary disadvantage of the situation. However, to truly eliminate unaccounted wealth, the government will need to constantly demonitize currency notes as unaccounted wealth is always built up over time. The citizens of the nation would not be supportive and ready to bear this sort of inconvienience time and again. Long waiting hours at banks, delayed business transactions, shortage of money, capped withdrawal amounts are some of the main causes for inconvienience among individuals in the country. Constantly demonitizing currency bills can prove to be a huge expense to the nation. The country being an underdeveloped nation needs funds for other causes that require more attention of the government. Hence, it is very essential for the government to place various measures in action and not use it as a stand-alone method of improving the country`s financial situation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is witnessing rapid urbanization and advancement of cities. It is expected that cities scross the &amp;nbsp;world will witness 1.8% of growth in the population each year. This has led to the rise in urban population in the year 2014. Urban population now accounts for 54% as compared to 34% of the total world population in the year 1960. However, the urban population in 2015-2020 is anticipated to be quiet leveled.Due to this radical change, the smart elevator market has seen a positive increase in its demand. The increase in population in cities will be facilitated by vertical expansion such as increased high-rise buildings due to the limited geographical space in cities. High-rise buildings would require smart elevators for transportation purposes. Therefore, The market for smart elevators is expected to grow exponentially by the year 2020. While developed nations such as France, U.S, UK and Canada already have modernized elevator systems that have contributed to a large revenue for the smart elevator market, developing Asian countries are not far behind and are expected to be offering great opportunities for smart, modernized versions of elevators by 2020. &amp;nbsp;53% percent of high-rise projects around the world are expected from China alone, where the use of smart elevators could be deployed. The phenomenal technological advancements and acceleration in the world towards building high-rise buildings contributes to the need for smart elevators that can facilitate comfortable, fast, secure vertical systems. Globally, green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are being put in place that are governing the need for smart elevators in existing and new infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deployment of these smart elevators surpasses the modernized segment by an increased revenue of 52% against the overall revenue of the market. The smart elevators have innovative technologies and features such as intelligent communication, access control and &amp;nbsp;security technologies. The use of these features vary depending on custom requirements of residences, commerical establishments, healthcare, hospitaility, industrial and many others. The customizable nature of smart elevators provide the end users with services that are extremely reliable, hygenic, excellent asthethics, rides, space, destination control and comfort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Due to intense competition in this market, global vendors of vertical transportation systems are reacting to the demand of smart elevators and moving their focus towards them to sustain in the market. ThyssenKrupp is a global vendor of vertical transportation systems that has a base of 1.1 million elevators to maintain and manage. The company has now made use of cloud capabilities to its systems which will enable them to gather data regarding systems and sensors and overall improve maintainence &amp;nbsp;services. PORT elevator technology has been installed and modernized by Schindler Elevator Corporation in the year 2014, at the Union Plaza office building located in Puerto Rico. The company has also installed smart elevators that have destination dispatch technology systems at locations such as the Bank of America in Manhattan, Humana Headquarters in Louisville, Hearst Tower, and at the Crescent in Dallas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;Commercial Application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall market could benefit with increasing growth due the commercial application of smart elevators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Smart elevators are being used with varied designs and capacities in industries such as offices, Hotels and Lodgings, financial institutions, healthcare and retail( malls and multiplexes). The difference requirement of capacity and design varies among industries, for example, the use of smart elevators in residential buildings as compared to commerical buildings differ due to the inter floor traffic. Hospitals require deeper elevators to facilitate stretchers. Malls and multiplexes require vandal proof material. Retail and warehouse requirements are inclined to spacious and ride comfort elevators. This proves the custom needs of each industry with regards to design and capacity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In large commercial buildings with more inter-floor traffic, the elevators consume large amounts of energy. This has opened up avenues for giant players in the market to provide innovative solutions with reduced requirement of power with the same experience, i.e, usage of smart elevators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such example of giant players in the market is Mitsubhishi. In the year 2011, the company developed multi-elevator smart technology that uses reduced amounts of energy by 10% approximately. Interestingly, this technology enables operational efficiency during peak hours. On the contrary, during lull times, it has the ability to maximize energy reduction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
