<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/24/2015 5:12:47 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century is &amp;nbsp;the age of Machines.As the time passes, one might be considered of Pre-Historic age if he doesnt know what is MS-OFFICE.!.We, under the name of modernisation, have always been entrusting on computers. One of the reasons, as found through general surveys, tell us that we have this belief of computers being accurate and efficent.Now, that is a reason but, the more we depend on computers, the more one looses control. It is in the sense that,a computer is a mere tool that helps in carrying out efficiency but, not the only one contributing. Studies conducted&amp;nbsp;on `Artificial Intelligence` have shown that the more advanced computers &amp;nbsp;are prone to becoming self-guided and may take over the control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; We cannot also ignore the merits of using a computer.It does help in reducing errors or mistakes.It does help in reducing time of completion of work or activity. Let`s not forget there always two sides of a coin.,.I do think that, this increased dependence on computers may take us to that age of Machines controlling every aspect than human beings who are considered dominating species in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Though ,now-a-days we use computers &amp;nbsp;in every other aspect, One shouldnot ignore the level of dependency ,which has been a revolution. Using computers in every other activity may create fatigue in the workmen. When there is everything computerised, there may soon, come a day when, there is hardly any employment for people. Has it not been for a person like Charles Babbage, There wouldnt be&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;a computer existing .! So, I think depending on computer is good to an &amp;nbsp;extent but, the level of dependency should be cautiously watched and &amp;nbsp;controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I can say that `Machines` controlling us, is not a good picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:SouthKorea2013EconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;South Korean economy looks to be doing its best as ever, as the economic indicators and, new and eased fiscal policy point to the growth prospects. It has been observed that, the quarterly GDP has hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013.Even better side of it is that, with inflation at a 14-year low, ther is likely to be a shift from low wages to real wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the economic position in Q1 2013 is encouraging, the fact, that the relative investment is weak , is not so encouraging. However, it is expected to cover that difference as the domestic consumers sentiment grow and as the global trade cycle moves up. On the other hand, the exports are unlikely to recover given continued Eurozone weakness and decling growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for both Industry and Consumers :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any economy to sustain and prosper, key contributing factor is `Production`.In the case of South Korea, the same is being proven.Its industrial production growth, which turned out to be positive after contractions in two preceeding financial years,is being reflected in the economy`s better doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth , driven by new orders from domestic as well as foreign while the former`s pace of expansion&amp;nbsp;being higher, can also be attributed&amp;nbsp;for an expected change in domestic consumption. Index went up to a high of 104 in May from 102 in April and this high of 104 was observed during March. The steps taken for economic growth such as - Ratifying a $4billion stimulus plan to `small and medium` enterprises, easing of the fiscal and monetary policies , have, so far, shown positive results. The fiscal deficit which was projected to rise to 1.8%,is manageable, given the low level of public debt(36% of GDP), current account surplus(3.8% of GDP) and, high total reserves of $323bn excluding gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With low inflation,BOK(Bank Of Korea) has eased its poli8cy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth but also, to prevent any sharp rise of South Korean`s Won`s against Japan`s Yen. This move by Bok to cut down rates by 25 basis points ,is likely to brek this trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
