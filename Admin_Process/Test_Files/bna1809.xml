List out and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Work from home is the best policy provided especially &amp;nbsp;for the women &amp;nbsp;employeesthese das.This is the convinient way to work when there is so much of stress in an employee`s life and when the fail to maintain a work life balance.Employees can give their best to the company`s development if they are given flexible timings to work.Coming to the women employees, this would be the best as they can peacefully work from home after completing their household chores especially &amp;nbsp;when they are on maternity leaves.The companies are now are also not following the boss and employee relationship to bring out good output from the employees. The main aim of such policies to be introduced is to bring the best from the employees.The companies have also become openminded as they have decreased the levels in the organization to cut down the gap between the different positions in the organization.Give and take is the best policy this is what the companies are practising now a days by giving the employees what they want and by getting back from the employees what the company want.The only disadvantage is that the employees lack the face to face interaction which is the main aspect in which the businesses are running.It is the kind of barrier for the communication in the process.Every aspect in the world has its own pros and cons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The advantages are the high output from the employees , less number of employees will be moving out from the organisation.There by increasing the satisfaction level in the employees.When the level of satisfaction is mopre in the employees the output will be increased. Less number of job rotations.More chances of employees staying in the organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The disadvantages are the threat of leaking of company`s confidential issues, and security threats.Loss of informationand misuse of the information.Time consuming process as the employees will not &amp;nbsp;work in the specific given time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:IndiaEconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After suffering the great crisis in the economy ,India has improved in a very remarkable way.India is one of the fastest growing ecconomy in the world today only because of the strong macro economic basics.There is another hurdle in the India`s growing economy,the domestic issues.As every night is followed by a brighter day,because of the strong policies it will recover in the fallen areas.The investment now that is made for making better tomorrow will help in growing in the same.&lt;br /&gt;According to the analysis,the current state of growing less will only remain till 2015.The GDP of the ncountry will increase to 40.7% from 36.6% by 2020.Infrastructure plays an important role in either increasing or decreasing the country`s economy in the recent years.The rate of savings are expected to increase from 39.5% from 33.8% as increase in nthe domestic savings increase in the domestic environment.Infrastructure plays a key role in the increasing of the economy.Increasing the employement opportunity and production efficiency and deacrese in the cost included in functioning of the business and icreased standard of living can increase the investment of the infrastructure 11.5% of GDP from 6% IN 2020.Expected increase in the health care sector because of focus of government in increasing the healthcare facilities has incresed from 1.3% to 2.2%.Private sector share in the infrastructure is expected to increase from 39.4% to 48.0%.The investment in &amp;nbsp;the agricultural sector is also expected to grow from 2.6% to 3.2%.&lt;br /&gt;Increase in the infrastructure helps in increasin the development of the nation in all the aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India Economic Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India remained remarkably resilient from the global economic turmoil in 2008 owing to its strong domestic fundamentals and had been one of the fastest economies to recover from the crisis. Currently, the growth momentum of the Indian economy has again been impacted. This time around besides the prevailing crisis in some of the developed economies, emergence of certain domestic issues had played a major role in restraining India&amp;rsquo;s growth momentum. However, we believe that India&amp;rsquo;s long term growth prospects will remain buoyant driven by its underlying strong macroeconomic fundamentals. We believe that emphasis on boosting investment activity and setting up of a favorable policy environment will act as a catalyst to unravel the growth potential of the Indian economy during the current decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The highlights of the analysis have been provided below &amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s macro-economic outlook 2020:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India is expected to be more than US$ 5 trillion (current market price) economy by FY20. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The size of the Indian economy will be comparable to the Japanese economy (in terms of GDP in US$) as of 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;We expect the current phase of subdued growth to continue till FY15 before the economy moves into a high growth phase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s economic growth during the current decade is expected to be driven by the buoyancy in the services sector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment activity is expected to accelerate going ahead, which will help the Indian economy achieve a higher growth rate. Share of investment to GDP will increase to stand at 40.7% of GDP during FY20 from 36.6% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Infrastructure will be both a cause and a consequence of economic growth during the current decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Strong growth in domestic savings will support domestic investment. The savings rate is expected to surge to 39.5% during FY20 from 33.8% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Under consumption, share of discretionary spending is expected to rise significantly to 70% of private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) as compared to 60.0% (P) in FY11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic growth drivers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Substantial investments in social and physical infrastructure will be the key growth drivers that will enable the economy to achieve &amp;lsquo;inclusive growth&amp;rsquo; over the current decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Infrastructure investment in the electricity sector is expected to account for 3.8% of GDP by FY20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment in physical infrastructure is expected to lead to employment generation, increased production efficiency, reduction in cost of doing business and improved standard of living which is expected to drive infrastructure investment (as measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation) to 11.5% of GDP by FY20 from around 6.0% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Increased government focus towards improving overall healthcare facilities is expected to enhance total government expenditure on healthcare to 2.2% of GDP in FY20, as against 1.3% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The share of the private sector in infrastructure financing is expected to increase from 39.4% in FY12 (P) to 48.0% in FY20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment in the agriculture sector is expected to grow to around 3.2% of GDP by FY20 as against 2.6% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
