<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;6/26/2014 4:14:24 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is India&amp;#39;s expenditure on hi-tech areas justified from the social and economic point of view. Elaborate giving reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India is a developing country. The economic growth story of India for the last 2 decades is very impressive. India is not only competing with the developed countries but also it is trying to match with the stiff competitions provided from other developing countries like China, Brazil, Russia and South Africa&amp;nbsp; (called as BRICS countries). So to be competitive and enhance the technical competencies, it is the need of India to invest in high tech areas. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;But questions arises, is it justifiable from social and economic point of view. As India is a country which is dominated by middle class, lower middle class&amp;nbsp;and below poverty line people. So it really raises eye brow of all those who are struggling with their daily life for a meal in a day. It is necessary to chord a balance between the investments in high tech areas and social areas. Indian Government has already so many social plans for the betterment of the society. But when we see the results of those programs and plans, it is disappointing. There is deep concerns when it comes to the implementation of those plans. Government needs rock bottom policy and procedures to reap the benefits of such programs. Corruption is another insect which is creating nuisances in our economy and standing on&amp;nbsp; acme against the development of our country. India needs&amp;nbsp; fast track courts to book the corrupted people. Corruption has spread its branches everywhere from the bottom level to the top level. Eradication of corruption is next to impossible for the time being but it is the right time to take some stringent&amp;nbsp;actions so that it can be stopped in further spreading of its root. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So the problem lies&amp;nbsp;in the policy making. There is huge amount of money available for developments. But it is up to government to decide how these chunk of tax payers money will be spent. I do believe that investment in high tech areas is necessary as it not only makes our country competitive in the world stage but also it creates huge amount of jobs. India has huge amount of population. It stands second after China. So this huge population need jobs to survive in the society. These high tech areas investments also attracts attention of foreign companies. It helps in getting foreign direct investments which helps our country to build foreign reserves and creates liquidity for the investments in the social and economic areas. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In conclusion, it is mandatory for a country to invest in high tech areas but it is the responsibility of the top notch people to decide how to draw a thin line between the share of investments in developmental sector and high tech areas.&amp;nbsp;Government needs concrete policy to get success in the social and economic areas. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
