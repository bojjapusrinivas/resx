Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would like to start the essay with one of the famous quotes "Health is wealth". with out proper health and hygiene conditions nobody can sustain. unfortunately in India a lot of people are suffering with out proper health care. if we take an example of rural population they are not even getting proper medication from the government.as we all know our government has been implementing many health policies to the backward people but we can find there are many loopholes in that programs. government should take necessary actions to avail the services provided by them to reach the people who need them at most. our prime minister has come up with many revolutionary ideas like Swatch bharat, financial inclusion and many more. there is necessity to come up with best medical care&amp;nbsp;support so that our country can cherish. I don`t support with the idea of commercializing the medical services. not only central government even state government should take care of its own citizens.&amp;nbsp;here I would like to quote one example of the prestigious program started by west Bengal to empower women in their state, "kanyashree". west Bengal government took it very passionately and the results are also fruitful. previously there are many child marriages in that state but as of now the number has been reduced. parents are actually&amp;nbsp; started sending their girl child to the schools with the support of their state government. basically school is a place where every one can learn precious things. school is also a place where one can understand the importance of being healthy and maintaining their surroundings cleaner. if we are succeeded in&amp;nbsp;habituating good food&amp;nbsp;habits to the children from their tender age&amp;nbsp;itself then there would be possibility for the children to build up cleaner and healthier environment around them. its always better to start infusing from the beginning. government also started "jan dhan yojana" scheme which specifies every individual should have a bank account and through this account&amp;nbsp;people would be fulfilling all their banking transactions. the main reason to start this is to avoid leakage of money given by the government to the people as pensions and others. with these accounts people would be getting their money directly from the government with out any intermediaries. like wise even money sanctioned in the name of health&amp;nbsp;services given to the people should directly reach them. commercialization of medical services may leads to many scams and poorer sections of the country wont be availing with all the medical facilities. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
