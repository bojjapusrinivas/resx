<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3/10/2016 10:43:53 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To inculcate the spirit on entrepreneurship in India, the Government launched &amp;lsquo;Start-up India&amp;rsquo; initiative in January 2016. Do you think this initiative would be a historic moment in ushering the era of economic prosperity in India. Please elaborate with reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Good Morning,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the Start -Up India is a great initiative taken by the present Government in power. Basically this initiative tells the young Indians not look at the greener pastures outside of our country. Just like many of us do that we graduate from here, learn the skills here and go abroad and work for a foreign company. But instead of that if we apply our learning`s here in our own country then the economy will be further boosted and there will be significant market expansion opportunity for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we succeed in this initiative then the foreign companies themselves will come to us and invest in our Organizations. Not only that if our youngsters turn into entrepreneurs then the whole of the country will look at them as role models and start following in their footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, Indians, have talent in abundance but need the right moment, guidance and opportunity. If the Government itself is willing to participate in our growth, then there is nothing like that.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All this while, say for the past 20 years, we have been hearing that India is a developing country. If the Start - Up India initiative is taken with utmost seriousness then I believe we will be a Developed Nation just like US, UK and China to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #008000;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the revolutionary changes in work places due to globalization, the facilities to be provided by the organizations should match the kind of work that we do. Elevators is one key segment out of this. There will be a significant growth which is expected in elevator business come the year 2020.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;With the huge numer of high rise buildings the demand has increased for a fast, comfortable, effiecient and secure vertical transportation system. Because of the worldwide green initiative the smart elevators have come into the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The upcoming modern smart elevator market is expected to cater to the needs of more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;As the buildings for Corporate offices, Malls and Movie Theatres are getting inceased day by day, there should be an affordable and comfortable ride for its customers` inside those buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The use and the dimensions &amp;nbsp;of elevator will differ from where it is getting used. For example in normal apartment and housing buildings you don`t see much of its usage as you see in a mall or a hospital. But with it`s advanced features it can cater to the need of any of the above segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;There is a significant growth in the number of rural people moving to cities and this growth will only go in one direction that is UP. Because in cities you will get pleny of opportunites where as in rural areas mostly farming is the most important segment that people will do. &amp;nbsp;So the more the number of people enter the cities the more amenities that we should be able to build, develop and sustain and elevators play a key role in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Global players such as Thyssenkrupp and Schindler Elevator Corporation are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators not only to remain competitive but to increase their presence globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Where in one angle we always speak of our lifestyles, habits, growth etc.. &amp;nbsp;on the flip side we also have to take care of our resources. That is why smart elevator is a perfect fit to consume less energy and still pass on the benefits of a normal elevator. Developped countires like US, UK, Canada and Frnace have already taken a giant step towards this Smart initiave of elevators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
