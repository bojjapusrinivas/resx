<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:30:14 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India being&amp;nbsp;one of the&amp;nbsp;largest country in the world among population and technology.And lots of educated people among the world are from India.But in India&amp;nbsp;most of the people doesn&amp;#39;t show much interest in medical field as they show in other fields.In other countries health insurance is must and should when compared to our country and our people doesn&amp;#39;t know about the healthcare services provided by the government and they even doesn&amp;#39;t knew what are the preventive steps to be taken when a person is infected with a particular disease.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The rules and regulations between one state and other differ a lot because of the ruling party gives different offers within the state.Most of our educated people are interested in settling in abroad than ther motherland because the income earned in abroad is more compared to India.The government has to educate people to take particular vaccines when a child is born newly such as tt,hepatitis and other vaccines also.The population records which are taken during decades are also not so current.People&amp;nbsp;those are poor&amp;nbsp;will not have money when they get a huge disease compare to rich.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Medicines which are rarely available should be preserved.The poor people who lives in villages even doesn&amp;#39;t know there will a treatement for this disesase which has been caused to them.Students should show interest in life science subjects and as much as possible they should become health specialists and serve the country.Some leaders doesn&amp;#39;t forward the medicines issued by the government to poor people who are suffering.the diet which we eat also is much important to be healthy,educating the people leads much improvement that before,many more labs yet should be established to have more supply of the medicine than demand.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Prevention is much better than cure.so firstly people should take care about their health knowing about the health standards,necessity of medicine.Being aware about the dublicate medicine,questioning about the problems faced and requirements they need.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Finally concluding that education changes everything for a better lifestyle,electing the right person for the government,supply should be more than that of demand,being aware about our health.personal interest is important than depending on others like government and others.One should prevent the cause before it effects.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
