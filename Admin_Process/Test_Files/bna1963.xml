<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/24/2015 5:14:50 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Yes, I agree that our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances. Because, the people are more addicted for readily made work and the manual power usage has been reduced by of the advanced technology. The advanced technology reduces the time consumption,production cost and the work will be more accurate.By using the ultimate power of technology one person can do the work of hundred persons simultaniously. This made the man so powerful. The ultimate benifits of advanced technology had made our lives so dependent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This dependence on technology is good for our overall development. By the advanced technology the we can seek good knowledge. The computer technology reduces the loads of work burden, it makes the live simple. For example, Registration for addmission in college. Number of people will apply for the seats for different streams, it is not so easy to sort them up by manually. But by using the computers it is so easy. The boundaries of knowledge are so wide. The knowledge helps in enhansement of ourselfs. "The dependence make us to be more alert, the alertness leads us to development".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:ChinaEconomicOutlookfo2013&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How fast can china grow? That is the question underlying about china`s economy these days. Growth of 7.7 percent inb first quarter was considered disapointing, but many analysts were expecting growth to revert to range of 8-9 percent. The government has forecast that growth this year will be 7.5 percent. but analyst had forecasted recently that growth is certainly slower than 7.8 in 2012, which was the slowest growth rate &amp;nbsp;in 13 years. Premeir &amp;nbsp;Li Keqiang indicated that china is " entering a range of reasonable growth". China has become a more mature economy with a declining labor force. Li said that a combination of industrializatin, urbanaisation, improvement in agriculture &amp;nbsp;productivity, and investment in technology can contribute to healthy growth of economy, it require more market-oriented reforms.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;further global integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves china`s economic relationship with rest of the world. China government &amp;nbsp;says that it studies the possibilities of joining Trans-Pacific Pact. Crrently ther are 12 countries involved in pacific basin making effort for free trade area among them.If china joins in TPP, the TPP will gain more than half of the global GDP. From china`s perspective, this cloud be a positive development. This allow free movement of prices of goods and credits. Still, the agreement on TPP is probably a long way off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China &amp;ndash; Economic Outlook for 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fast can China grow? That is the question underlying much of the discussion about China&amp;rsquo;s economy these days.Clearly, double digit growth is not in the cards and may even be a thing of the past.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Growth of 7.7 percent in the first quarter was considered disappointing, and, until recently, many analysts were expecting growth to revert to the range of 8&amp;ndash;9 percent. Yet now the government appears determined to reset expectations. The government has forecast that growth this year will be 7.5 percent, a good deal lower than many private analysts had forecast only recently. That is certainly slower than the 7.8 percent growth in 2012, which was the slowest rate of growth in 13 years. Premier Li Keqiang, in a recent speech in Germany, said that growth for the remainder of the decade will average an even lower 7.0 percent per year. Although far slower than the growth experienced during the past two decades, Li indicated that China is &amp;ldquo;entering a range of reasonable growth.&amp;rdquo; Given that China has become a more mature economy with a declining labor force, Li is probably correct in setting more modest expectations. Moreover, growth of 7.0 percent is not bad: It doubles the GDP in 10 years. Li said that a combination of industrialization, urbanization, improvements in agricultural productivity, and investments in technology can contribute to healthy growth, and that this requires more market-oriented reforms. He also said that &amp;ldquo;for a very big economy, this is not easy.&amp;rdquo; When and how such reforms will be implemented remains uncertain. While some reforms have been announced, many government statements have been relatively vague. With a new regime just installed, it could take some time to build the support necessary to implement much needed reforms. In the interim, China faces some risks, including the ramifications of large local government debt, considerable leverage in the shadow banking system, and weaker-than expected manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing weakness stems from weakness in export markets. In addition, rising wages in China are having an adverse impact on export competitiveness, thereby leading to an exodus of manufacturing capacity. Thus, even growth in the range of 7&amp;ndash;8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further global integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves China&amp;rsquo;s economic relationship with the rest of the world. China&amp;rsquo;s government now says it will study the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP), an effort to create a free-trade area in the Pacific Basin. Currently there are 12 countries involved in this effort: the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. If China joins the group, the TPP will collectively account for more than half of global GDP. Freer trade would entail not simply lowering tariffs and quotas, although this would be an important component. It would also involve freeing up domestic markets so that they would have to compete freely with foreign companies. From China&amp;rsquo;s perspective, this could be a positive development in that it would create pressure to privatize state-run companies, create a level playing field for the private sector, and allow free movement of prices of goods and credit. Still, agreement on the TPP is probably a long way off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
