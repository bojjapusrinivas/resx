If we look at the present politics and their dramas to get benifited one more time they are making so much ground work to make the Indian people fools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian youth has to participate in politics because they are well known of the problems they are facing, obiously they are well aware about &amp;nbsp;to solve their problems. If they do not do this our old politician will robb the country one more time as they have been doing the for so many years. In recent days most of youth who have turned 18 years have enrolled their names voters list as it is one of their primary rights. Enrolling their names in voters list is not important, the most critical part is choosing the right person as their leader. As we have been watching on News and News papers, most of our politicians playing mind games every day to fulfill their desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;As we look at the last week Loksabha and Rajyasabha sessions most of the leaders are not bothering about &amp;nbsp;People of India they only think about their political Career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To teach them a good lesson, youth should think of every politician and cast their votes, then only Indian people can be saved from these evils.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
