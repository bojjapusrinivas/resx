What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Answer:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There is always some disparity between rural and urban areas&amp;nbsp;of India.When the question comes that &lt;strong&gt;Does living in Big Cities offer benefits in comparison to rural areas?&lt;/strong&gt; the answer is always &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;. Because there are more facilities and ammenities are available in big cities.The major difference is in the&amp;nbsp;availability of basic and fundamental needs like constructions, water facilities, electricity and the most vital need of education.But taking into account these things, is it the right solution to go to the big cities only? Surely not.Insted of relocating to the big cities we, the young youth, which is considered as a most valuale asset of the country, should try to convert rural areas into the urban areas facilitiwise.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In Sanskrit Language, there is a proverb&amp;quot; Janani Janmbhumishch swargaapi Gariyasi&amp;quot; which means your native , your born place is like a heaven for one if one gives a real try.We should take this as a inspiration and sould try to remove the disparity between the rural India and Urban India. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There are many ways, such as , rural India still have&amp;nbsp;assets like natural resources and green lands, we should preserve the same along with hisorical places and we can also develop the places for the tourism.It will generate income for rural areas and they can also grow and develop.We can built schools,&amp;nbsp;liabraries for rural people. In this case we can take&amp;nbsp;inspiration from Sudha Murthy who is continuously taking efforts to develop rural India.We can also provide them internet support with proper guidance so that not only rural India and Urban india, but the whole world can come nearer.If we constribute our little money or if it is not possible then&amp;nbsp;our some time, we can built home for them even in a single day, with the help of some institutions.The root cause of disparity is unemployment in rural areas, but we can remove it with the help of Internet and onlie options as well as we can&amp;nbsp;provide proper support to the rural youth so they can start their own businesses.The most important thing, the rural India posseses is agicultural lands and which contributes major part in Indian GDP and Economy.Though government provides facilities to farmers, they are not in adequate proportion.Again many scams and cheating cases are there.In real world, the facility is not actually reaching to the main and needy person or it is reaching after so many monetary sacrifices, as the reason of that many farmers prefers to quit the farm and relocate to urban areas and starts labour works. Even this gaves new problems as child labours and increasing density in urban areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As there is will there is a way, we, young youth, should really try and contribute to remove the disparity between rural and urban areas in India, so our country will be truly equal and inspite of various graceful cultures, it will be truly Incredible and golden India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
