Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Clean india is a mission that has been started by our Prime Minister MR.Narendra modi with an aim to make india clean.He named it as SWACCH BHARATH mission it is an awareness program to keep india clean by this mission he bought awreness among many people.The celebraties like cricket players,film stars promoted this program by implementing this in real life they also broght awarenes among the people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Awarenes is important if we bring &amp;nbsp;awareness among people than atomatically the awareness convert into action.In india many people will follow the film and cricket stars if they promote any movement then the young stars also follow them and implement them by this the movement will also succed.So first the attitude of the people should change then automatically it will convert into action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The attitude of the people should change."Charity begin from home".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; First the attitude of the people in india should change many of the people support the swachh bharath mission and they conduct awareness program for one day for the name sake after than they will forget about that program.Awareness help to motivate or to change the attitude of the people but more important is to convert awareness into action."Action speeks more than words".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Celebraties conducting awareness program and they also cleaning the streets for the publicity purpose.They should conduct awarness program and also should contribute funds for the program.It not only the resposibiity of politicians and celebraties but also the responsibility of the common man.The attitude of the common man should change.Everyone blame the politicians charity begin at home.The change should be begin from home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; First we should think about how to keep the city clean.the main cause is pollution.Our government started the ODD OR EVEN program.The main purpose of the program is to keep city traffic free and pollution free but the people are not following the rule they are breaking the rule by buying two or more cars.By this their is no use of intoducing the rule.the atitude of the people should change they should feel this as their responsibility.The students the future citizens the awareness program should start from the schools.The students should come volunteerly and conduct programs.The corporate companies should also conduct the awareness program vounteerly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Every one should join hands to keep india clean.It is not possible by one person blaming the politician is not the solution.Awareness is important to start or to motivate the people to make india clean implimentation is important.It is in every one hand to make india clean its time for implemtation not for awareness.To keep india clean charity start from home and join hands for the swacch bharth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; There should be a motivator to motivate the people in initial stage but to implement the program it is in everyone hands.If you are given a brick it is in in your hand than to make wall out of it are to make bridge out of it.Its our choice that what way we choose.It is all there in our hands to follow the rule or break the rule.If we feel india is our country automatically the peolpe will start implementing the programt.so attitude of the people should change than the movement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
