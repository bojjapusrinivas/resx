<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/18/2013 10:34:51 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which sector, in your opinion, plays the most important role in driving the economic condition of a country? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to me, Education sector plays most important role in driving the economic condition of the country. Because I think, there is a lot of mentality difference between an educated and uneducated person. An educated person&amp;nbsp;knows&amp;nbsp;how to deal in the house and out the house. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;An educated person knows how to make Rs. 10 from Rs. 1 and save for future also, but for an uneducated person Rs. 1 means to spend in present and nothing for future. For this I had seen an example at my home, Our servant who get Rs. 500 for each work. She never saved a single penny for future. Because whenever she got her monthly payment, she usually spend it at unusual things like buying jewellary, things related to make up, Costly clothes etc&amp;nbsp;and this does not happened once in year but in every month. Whenever she need money in urgency she never had a single&amp;nbsp;penny saved and she goes door to door to take advance payment then. We had tried to tell her many times that you worked so hard and also you earned well, so save some money for future urgency also. But she never understands this. If she was educated she will definately&amp;nbsp;know what money values and how to save it for future. So&amp;nbsp;this leads to poor economic conditions of the country because she had money for one day but for rest of the days of the month she will have nothing. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So if education is given to everybody in the country, then they will know how to manage the money and no body in country will remain poor and this will lead to better economic conditions of the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Many people thinks if everybody will be educated then unemployment also increases and it will effect economic conditions of the country also. But as per my thinking if everybody will be educated then people will now how to earn money in right way, they will know what is exactly happening in the world. They can the country to higher level also and compete with forgien countries. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There are lot of people who had never been to school for single day. They had not any knowledge about what is happening around them. Like taking example of our servant here also: our servant&amp;#39;s daughter is also not educated and she is around 15 years old. At this age, she still does not have any knowledge about numbers, alphabets. She come to our home and read the newspaper, But she only see pictures in the newspaper. She does not know&amp;nbsp;what is written in newspaper. For her everything is like&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Kala Akhsar bhains brabar.&amp;quot; She also does not know that if she is going to buy something then how much money she had to pay. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Other thing which is also mostly happens in uneducated people&amp;nbsp;which also leads to poor economic condition of country. They do not have any family planning which leads to increase of population. Like our servant&amp;#39;s daughter, she is very eager to get married soon at this early age. She does not know what are the disadvantages to getting married at early age. We had tried many times to tell her that marriage is not only the solution of life, there are lot of reasponsibilities after marriage also which she can&amp;#39;t handle at this early stage of life. If she was educated she will be known that what is right age to get married as per India Goverment rules. According to uneducated people, getting married and give birth to chidren is the only life, they can live. As per their thinking, beyond this there is no life. They come to earth as human being just this means getting married and then children. Secondly, they also don&amp;#39;t think that in today&amp;#39;s time it&amp;#39;s getting tough to fill the stomach of one child and they are planning&amp;nbsp;3-4 or even more than this. So all this leads to poor economic conditions and more population of the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;On the other hand, an educated person get married only when he/she able to earn money and when he/she stands properly at their feet so that in future they can&amp;#39;t beg in front of others. They know about family planning also. They know how to behave in public and also they can teach their children also. An educated person thinks about present but also about future.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So from all above, I just want want to conclude that education should be must because an educated person can take his/her country to high levels. Also goverment is also trying that everybody should be educated so that the economic conditions of country would become better.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
