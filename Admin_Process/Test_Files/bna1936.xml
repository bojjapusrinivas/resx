<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/27/2015 5:08:35 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes ofcourse, our dependence on computers increased tremendously. Computers plays an important role as we can get a lot more information. We can search for any information. Previously there are no computers and people use to get information through books.They use to refer a lot many books to gather required information. They use to do the things manually which is a time taking job and is very difficult. But &amp;nbsp;now,the technology has been increased a lot. People are doing their work through computers. The thing is that through computers we can get as much as information we need.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are very much intrested in buying their products through online and even they are booking their tickets through online.Even here, computer plays a major role. Technology is increasing day-by-day. Going back to the generations of computers, as we know that there are 5 generations of computers. They have used punch cards, transistors etc so here in each generation technology has been increased. Now-a-days , people are fond of using social networking sites like facebook, twitter, etc. Most of us are becoming &amp;nbsp;dependent on computers. In IT sectors they need to work on computers for hours together. They need to communicate to the on-site people through computers bt sending e-mails, or through fax.Most of the information will be stored in a computer it could be confidential information even. The employees who so ever are working in the organization, their details will be stored in a database. Its is very difficult to write manually the details of all the employees working in the organizations.Even in schools or colleges, the student`s information will be stored in a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are totally dependent on computers. This dependence is good for the overall development &amp;nbsp;because, the technology has been increasing day-by-day and we are making use of that technology.But, we should make the best use of it .Even the civil engeneers, for preparing their plans for construction are dependent on computers. People are very innovative and they are introducing newer technologies. Online marketting , E-commerce, E-business are available &amp;nbsp;and people are opting for it.If a person wants to buy a new mobile or any other product, first he will search in the computer, the various models available, and compares the prices of each and then he comes to a conclusion. This can even be done by visiting a mobile store. But, by using computer he can get the information very quickly without putting much efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, right from the invension of the computer by Charles babbage, they have become a part of our lives. Without computers, we can`t imagine how the situation could be. As technology is advancing, our lives are becoming more dependent on computers because, the increasing technology is attracting the people towards it and is providing them with a great comfort in using computers.So there are greater advantages in using computers.So it is good to be dependent on computers for overall development. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013GlobalAutoIndustryOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, in order to survive in a global market we need to satisfy the customers. We need to know the tastes and preferences of the customers.The preferances of the customers changes day-by-day.SAo we need to take it into account and we need to design the product accordingly.To remain competitive, we need to analyze the our compititor`s move.The main theme is to maximize the profits by minimizing the costs. As it is mentioned that the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features, these features should be in such a way that the customers should get attracted and should be satisfied and yes even the buyers gets attracted even towards the small and less gas-guzzler vehicles. Obviously, the sale of optional features will help them offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to the large trucks.Even the automakers continue to shift &amp;nbsp;their production facilities from high cost regions to lower cost regions.The sales of cars have been increasing day-by-day. This is because they are designing their plans innovatively according to the needs and wants of the customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good to here that &amp;nbsp;the role of government is highly significant and is &amp;nbsp;strongly responsible in moulding the auto industry in coming years and even the US government is ready to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 &amp;ndash; Global Auto Industry Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In the first five months of 2013, General Motors Company ( GM ) led with a 18.0% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. ( F ) with a 16.4% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. ( TM ) with a 14.2% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 11.7% market share, and Honda Motor Co. ( HMC ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( NSANY ) at the last spots with 9.5% and 8.1% market shares, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;OPPORTUNITIES &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;To remain competitive, the automakers will need to design vehicles that will cater to consumers in both mature and emerging markets while manufacturing them at low-cost using the most advanced technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;For example, Ford has undertaken "One Manufacturing" strategy, which aims at producing multiple models from plants across the world in order to save production costs and fast adaptation to changes in consumer tastes. The automaker anticipates producing 4.5 models at each of its plants by 2015, up from 3.6 models currently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Further, the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features (which will save money on gas), even on the small and less gas-guzzler vehicles in order to attract buyers. The sale of optional features is helping them offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to large trucks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The automakers continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. According to a study by CSM Worldwide, China and South America together will represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The role of governments is highly significant. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years. In late 2011, 13 major automakers, including Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Volvo, have signed letters of commitment with the U.S. Government to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
