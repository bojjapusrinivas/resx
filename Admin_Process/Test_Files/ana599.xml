<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/24/2013 2:36:27 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Significance of Ethics in Sports? Do you think betting in IPL should be legalized to avoid recent match fixing scams? Elaborate with reasons&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sports in India where it is regarded as a religion and passion&amp;nbsp;as well as worldwide in any format is&amp;nbsp;considered to be a gentleman&amp;#39;s game. Young aspirants as well as expierenced individuals&amp;nbsp;across various socio, economic and cultural backgrounds join, practice and pursue this noble profession either due to their aptitude and ability for the specific sports&amp;nbsp;discipline or&amp;nbsp;being&amp;nbsp;a suitable avenue for serving their country.Every sportsmen/women is a torch bearer of his/her nation/region be it in international events( viz. Olympics/Asian Games/Commonwealth games) or domestic competitions(eg.Ranji/Duleep Trophy etc). Therefore participation in these sports&amp;nbsp;activties brings along with it associated expectations&amp;nbsp;of professional behaviour and high levels of code of conduct and ethical behaviour by the individuals.Whenever an incident of breach of norms or ethics is reported through either sting operations by print and electronic media or independent sources it only results in maligning the reputation of the individual but also tarnishing the image and pride of the country. There have been several instances in the past where participants have been caught in controversies pertaining to doping, match fixing etc across nations. This not only spoils the career prospects of the individual committing the crime but also hampers the credibility of the nation vying for higher accomplishments and recgnitions. In order to safeguard the interest and sanctity&amp;nbsp;of the game it is an absolute imperative&amp;nbsp; that people with credible backgrounds are allowed to form part of these sporting events.Also the legislation and accountability parameters&amp;nbsp;of various sporting authorities and associations like BCCI,ICC,various football, tennis and other bodies should be independent, tranparent to ensure justice. Along with that sportsmen should not be allowed to use the game as a precursor&amp;nbsp;to satisfy their malicious motives of settlement of personal scores/ revenge and outdo competition as was evident during the controversies that clouded the pairing of tennis participants during last olympics.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Cricket in India is considered to be a game that evokes stronger emotions than relegion specially with specific nations and is considered a passion among all age groups. This has resulted over the years in immense and rapidly expanding&amp;nbsp;amount of government support as well as private sponsorships of various cricketing events as well as brand endorsements for cricketers in the recent past. With the involvement of corporates , industries , celebrities in this noble game brough along with it the paradox of higher stakes, increased performance pressures in short duration for higher monetary incentives.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;IPL in the past 5-6 years is an consequent emergence of the peculiar nature of sports activities and the manner in which sports is considered a major revenue generating platform for individuals as well as entities. The cricketers are bought and sold by auction similar to commodities. Thereby it leaves no option for individuals to reap results for themselves and their promoters but to indulge in unlawful activities like betting , spot fixing match fixing etc. Even the umpires who are held responsible to uphold the rules of the game and enforce discipline are getting themselves involved in controversies bringing further disrepute to the game.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Legalizing betting by no means can be accepted as a viable option to control the match fixing instances. Instead it would lead to further more number of and aggravated instances of scandalous behavior by parties concerned. This would happen primarily as there would not remain any value and significance associated with honesty, integrity, hard work, dedication&amp;nbsp;considered to be primary benchmarks of success in any sports. Therefore the only long term and viable solution remains in strengthening the regulations controlling the activities of various sportspersons and governing bodies&amp;nbsp;. Also the authorities assigned at the helm of responsibilities&amp;nbsp;must be people from highly acclaimed and credible backgrounds to ensure impartality in decison making and avoid biasnes in selections.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As a closing note would like to mention that prevention is always considered better than cure so to ensure IPL and cricket functions smoothly, the interest of the game needs to be jointly protected by the particpants, legislators and the government.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
