<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/25/2015 5:07:07 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic and infrastructural planning of an area should be done bearing in mind the environment conservation. To what extent do you agree with this statement? Provide reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The development of the society, the country and the world is the major issue ongoing everywhere. The development can be through the way of individual person or through the way of infrastructural planning or through the way of economic development. The economic planning concern with the people, their status and the countries position where as the infrastructural planning is concerned with the factors that make the coutry developed and makes the life easy for the people staying in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment concern is sometimes mssing while making progress in economies and the infrastructure sector. Lets say when there is the path way to be constructed from one part of country to the other villege of the country then the forest area should be the way which requires chopping of tress and also hampering the livelihood of animal. The decision should be taken appropriately and carefully which takes consideration of economic and environmental factors. The metro line is being constructed in hyderabad which leads to the air pollution, compensation measures are to be taken to protect the environment. The planning of area which includes economic as well as infrastructural development should take into consideration the environmental factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the time passes and the competition are going on the need of everything is being changed and everything is being urgent. The demand of confortable life of every people of the country is very high. This leads to need for economic and infrastrutural planning. The environment conservation should go side by side with each and every planning that is made. If there is chop of one tree then there should be the plantation of two tress. The global environment &amp;nbsp;as a whole is to be taken into consederation. It is the fact that economic development and infrastructural development will not be sucessfull if the environment is degraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now a days, the regional groups like SAARC are also concerned about the environmental protection. They are serious not only for the economic development they have also made their effort for the environment protiection. The global warming that the world is facing can be reduced only if the the environmental concern goes hand in hand with every decision that is made. The popular organizations like Coca Cola and others are participating in the Corporate Social Responsibity (CSR) programs taking environment as its major issue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will not be use of any development achieved and any infrastructure built if the environmental hazard goes on. The world can servive only if the participants of the world are equally treated and managed. So, I undoubtly agree that the economic and infrastrutural planning of an area should be done bearing in mind the evironmental conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 14pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;U.S. Market Recovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for the vehicle among the people of US and the increase in the job creation rate was the reason for the boost up of the auto market. The demand of latest model and the usage of the vehicle goes on increasing as the year passes from 2012 to 2013. The finacial support was giving by making of the banks to encourage buying of vehicles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sales growth in auto market took place as the year passes, this growth rate was obtained on sesonally adjusted rated basis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 14pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Economic Crisis in Europe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurozone financial crisi as the major concern of world has effected entire world auto market. The main brands GM and Ford are mainly hampered. The auto market in Europe decreased becasue of the economic fluctuation and insecurity in the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing market of Europe suddenly falls down to the lowest sales of 12.05 million in 2012 scince 1995, quoted by European Automobile Manufactures` Association (ACEA). The demand decreased and the major supporting &amp;nbsp;banks stop being flexible to provide car loans.&amp;nbsp;The sales keeps on going down all over Eurozone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic crisis &amp;nbsp;leads to job cuts and plan closures as the operation was not feasible. This increses the unemployment rate significantly even in a month, March from 10.9% to 10.3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S automakers, Ford plan to tranfer its plant to UK and Belgium in comming two years While GM operates in Bochum plant in Germany. This gives employment to 3100 workers in year 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European automakers plans to expand the job in France while the Flat and Peugeot decide to down size. Like wise the crisis in Europe effect Japanese automobiles aswell which decides to terminate number of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 - Auto Industry Outlook for the US and Europe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;U.S. Market Recovery &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Strong pent-up demand due to aging vehicles on the U.S. roads along with falling unemployment rate have been the key factors in driving the auto sales in the U.S. Average age of vehicles on U.S. roads increased to 11.3 years in January 2013 from 10.8 years in 2012. Banks were also friendlier as they offered greater access to loans with lower interest rates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% to the five-year high of 14.5 million vehicles in 2012. In May 2013, auto sales in the U.S. grew 8.2% to 1.44 million units while it rose 10.9% to 15.3 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted rate (SAAR) basis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Economic Crisis in Europe &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The present Eurozone financial crisis has adversely affected the operations of many global automakers, especially GM and Ford, who have a significant exposure to the market. Car sales in Europe continued to be low owing to weak consumer confidence on the back of a weak economy triggered by the crisis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;According to the European Automobile Manufacturers` Association (ACEA), car sales in Europe reached its lowest level of 12.05 million units in 2012 since 1995, indicating a year-over-year decline of 8.2% due to the sagging demand for cars, as highly indebted banks were reluctant to finance new car purchases for customers. The decline was the steepest in the highly troubled Eurozone, where car sales dipped 11.3% to roughly 9 million units, according to Reuters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Most of the major automakers in Europe are resorting to job cuts and plant closures, as it became no longer feasible for them to undertake full-fledged operations in the continent. Unemployment in the EU reached 26.5 million in Mar 2013, while the unemployment rate increased to 10.9% in the same month from 10.3% in Mar 2012. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the U.S. automakers, Ford plans to shut vehicle and component plants in the U.K. and Belgium in the next two years while General Motors would suspend car production at its Bochum plant in Germany -- which employs 3,100 workers -- in 2016. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the European automakers, Renault plans to retrench 7,500 jobs in France by 2016 while each of Fiat and Peugeot has decided to eliminate 1,500 jobs. Among the Japanese automakers, Honda announced plans to terminate 800 jobs at its South Marston plant near Swindon, southwest England in the second quarter of 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
