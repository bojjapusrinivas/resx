<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:31:31 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Yes, I agree with you that in India there is a mismatch in the supply and demand of health care despite of many measurements taken by our government. The reasons would be lack of technology, funds to buy equipment&amp;nbsp; required, professionals moving abroad, etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Of course, Government has launched many&amp;nbsp;schemes to provide health care to BPL families and&amp;nbsp;even middle class families, still many people are not receiving the complete health care. The reasons are many hospitals do not have all the equipment needed to diagnise &amp;amp; operate on the disease of patients.&amp;nbsp;Few medicines are costly &amp;amp; many medical halls &amp;amp; hospitals only maintain few stock of such medicines. In some cases, they are only ordered on request of the people which is time consuming.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;The main problem is with the funds.&amp;nbsp;In spite of existence of&amp;nbsp;innovative &amp;amp; skilful people in our country, they are discouraged due to the&amp;nbsp;lack of funds &amp;amp; because of the high&amp;nbsp;costs that would be incurred for carrying out their research.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Poor people can&amp;#39;t afford costly medicines &amp;amp; hospitals are not ready to treat them for free. The funds the government is announcing for these class people are not actually reaching them in some cases &amp;amp; in some cases its too late in reaching them. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;The other problem&amp;nbsp;in existence&amp;nbsp;is, even in these days&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;computer era, rural area people have to travel through miles for their treatment. They don&amp;#39;t have hospitals in their localities. Only people they rely upon is RMP&amp;#39;s who could only provide them with first aid. Few villages don&amp;#39;t have these RMP&amp;#39;s also. They don&amp;#39;t even have appropriate transport facilities to travel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Another problem is availability of professionals. Many people are&amp;nbsp; moving abroad because they are paid more there than in our country. They have more opportunities&amp;nbsp;in foreign compared to India.&amp;nbsp;The government should take measures to retain its professionals in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;steps to be taken by the government:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Organizing regular health camps for people in rural &amp;amp; urban areas.This&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;would help in actually estimating(number of patients affected with a disease, at what stage they are, etc. ) the demand for medicines.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Allowing subsidiaries for pharmaceutical companies for manufacturing costlier medicines.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Encouraging pharmacists in our country with scholarships or giving them loans, &amp;nbsp;to carry their research.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Granting the pharmaceutical companies in an economical &amp;amp; reliable&amp;nbsp;area such that they would not face any interruptions( in input supply, transport facilities, power supply, etc.) in their manufacturing process.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Providing low cost treatment for BPL families in super speciality hospitals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Government releases funds for the treatment of poor people under the schemes like Arogyasri.&amp;nbsp;Measures are to be taken to check out whether the funds released are really utilized for the purpose they are intended.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Constructing small&amp;nbsp;hospitals in rural areas or sending medical representatives at regular intervals&amp;nbsp;so that people can &amp;nbsp;atleast receive&amp;nbsp;first aid.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Increasing the number &amp;nbsp;of ambulances for rural areas so that&amp;nbsp;people could reach for&amp;nbsp;treatment on time.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Tie up&amp;#39;s with foreign hospitals which&amp;nbsp;are having all the good enough&amp;nbsp;technology(equipment),professionals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Allowing&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;FDI&amp;#39;s in pharmaceutical &amp;amp; health care industries.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
