Plastic is one of the major sources of environment contamination in the current world. Due to it`s easy avaialbility and cheaper cost it has become a contaminating the slarge part of our lives, from carry bags to water bottles and thus became the larger component of waste management. Millions of tons of such one use plastic is being either dumped in the ocean or the dump yards which produce toxic gases. When the plastic waste is being dumped in the ocean, it is advcersely effecting the marine environment and causing imbalance to the sea life and contaminating the waters, and while it is burnt the toxic gases are produced and cause ozone depletion, air pollution, decrease the purity of the breathable air for humans e.t.c. When dumped in foodgarbage,, animals such as cows and sheep eat it and because it is un-digestable, they end up suffering or die in many cases. In order to reduce such adverse effects many governments across the world has decided to ban the single-us platic commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;This ban of single use plastic has created queit a lot of controversy as it has been the primary and cheapest source of baggage avaialble in the market. The ban states that, plastic below a few microns thickness shall not be used at all. Many vendors ranging from local vegetable sellers to large super markets and shopping malls that had previously used such plastic and had bulk amounts of such bags already at their hand uproared in despair since they have the comoddity in larger quantitities. People started illegally using single use plastic bags such as small vendors where as larger organizations started manufacturing their own plastic bags and started chraging for them. Bring your own bag or pay for one has become their mantra. Such is the case with water bottles, bottles which were thrown into garbage without cost consideration are now being collected by cleaners and are selling them in exchange for money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Though there has been a slight pressure on the society monetarily because of single use plastic ban act, It has started showing results slowly as the amount of plastic beinmg dumped into garbage has reduced significantly from each household and combined the values, it is a very large amount of difference that is being made towards our environment. Plastic recycling bins have been implemented whcih give coupons inexchange of plastic waterbottles, and in place of single use plastic bags, people started using cloth or jute bags which are durable and can be used for a very large period of time. Waste manage system of the country has also started taking measures to seperate plastic from the waste collected and ocean clean up programs have started where plastic is being cleaned from the marine environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The best measure for the current society is not "econnomy vs environment" but rather "environment along with economy". Instead of paying for plastic bags of permissible thickness everytime we go to the market or malls, if we carry a cloth bag with ourselves, we not only reduce the amount of plastic being used but also will end up paying way less money when compared to plastic bags. Similarly instead of purchasing single use waterbottles, if every individual carries a bottle with themselves, they can fill it again and reuse it. Alternatives such as compressible bottles have also come into the market which consume less space when not in use. By using such practices we can save the environment and our planet one step at a time, and after a few years our planet earth though may not reach its previous glory, will definitely start improving and in return provides us with fresher air and cleaner water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"&gt;Compact SUV`s are currently the most in-popular vehicles being preferred by people in many countries through out the world such as Australia, China, the United States, Btitan e.t.c. Better handling and lower fuel consumption per mile of small SUV`s has been the added advantage they have been seeing over passenger cars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"&gt;Only in Australia, the slaes have increased by 28 percent in the first half of 2015 for smaller SUV`s. Thanks to their off-road features and spaciousness, cars such as&amp;nbsp; Holden Trax, Nissan Qashqai and Hyundai iX35 are the best sellers of Australian market thus providing a better position for autos market which shrank the previous year by 2 percent. Not only the smaller SUV`s, but the country has also seen an increase of 12 percent&amp;nbsp;in medium SUV`s and 6 percent in large SUV`s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"&gt;Though Passenger cars are a larger share in Australia`s automarker with sales of 40000 in 90000 cars in a month, the value is just slightly above SUV`s which is 30000 cars. According to Richard Jhons, head of Australian Automative Intelligence, the sales of SUV have rose from 39 to 91, while passenger cars have just gone up from 85 to 112. From the past 10 years of Federal chamber of automotive industries dats,&amp;nbsp; the sales of SUV`s has gone up by 5.8 percent, while that of passenger cars have come down by 7.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
