<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/9/2015 5:27:54 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical care is a basic necessity of citizens, but people are mostly concerned about their well being and not that of the others. Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;I could like to start with a quotation that i.e Health is wealth .If wealth is lost we can regain it but if health is lost it is very difficult to gain it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Medi care sector is growing day by day .we can see many changes in the medical sector .there were days when we were not having proper medical facilities .but now we can see many changes in it like technology ,innovative products,lot of research is done on medicines, diseases,etc .It because of necessity of medical treatments .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;During late 80s we the citizens were not having proper knoweldge of medical and treatments were availabile for only few diseases and that too in small in number it was so because of lack of knowledge ,technology ,logistics problem .But now as technology as increased we can see many pharmacy shops,hospitals ,research centers, colleges and lot more.and now we have both government and prviate hospiatls were we have choice to select the kind of service we want and also govt is providing subsidaries for poor people for medical ,if we want to &amp;nbsp;have health insurance we can do it.The development in medical is done because for a country to grow we need to have proper medical facilites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;for example:-They were many diseases like hiv/aidas,swine-flu,bird flu ,chicken gunia etc and at the same time we have steps to control it ,vaccines ,etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The current stiuation is people are more concern about there livelyhood which gives them enjoyment or we can say that people are least brother about there health and became careless .They spend theiir money in buying luxury houses,costly and updated phones , cars etc.because of development in medical the people became lazy .Like people know that smoking,alchcol &amp;nbsp;is injuries to health but also they ingore it and have it;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;we can see that medical is promoted by advertsing,media.awareness etc.The bollywood and tollywood stars are been promoting the various issues like pilo drops,hiv/aidas.The modi government is promoting sawch bharat i.e is to keep the surroundings neat and clean thats because of health issues.if we dont keep surroundings neat the chance of getting a disease is more .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;It is necessary to commerciazle the medical services because if a country have more deathrates than birthrates it effects the country and due commerciazation we can see a two to three medical shops in every street .and there will be many improvements in the sector .There will be a &amp;nbsp;solution for every disease .If we wont commericazle it there will be no improvements in the sector .the treatment will be not good and commeriazle me4ans in terms of improvements not in the rate of charging the service .many medical cares charge huge amounbt for a simple disease it should be encouraged its gives a negative impact to the citizens .the commercization should be done in aproper and systematic manner such that everyone gets benfits out of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
