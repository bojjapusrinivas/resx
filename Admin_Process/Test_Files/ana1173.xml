<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:31:03 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes, there is an enormous&amp;nbsp;gap between healthcare supply and demand. I think there are many major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country like:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government need to provide many hospitals&amp;nbsp;mostly for&amp;nbsp;those who are in need like poor and middle class people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It can provide free treatment for patients, proper medicines, and also provide many other facilities like good furniture cleanliness etc.,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;These days&amp;nbsp;there are many ambulances provided when there is a sudden accident occurring at&amp;nbsp;any situation on roads r in any other places.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It can improve health care sector by educating many of the children&amp;nbsp;and students, our country can be developed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Now-a-days their are many accidents&amp;nbsp;occurring on&amp;nbsp;roads by the people because of&amp;nbsp;no proper rules and regulations, no&amp;nbsp;awareness about safety programmes, no proper driving, not following traffic rules, etc., these things need to be taken care for improvement.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The increasing&amp;nbsp;population&amp;nbsp;in our country effects the globalisation like pollution, health disorders, also the heath problems like cancer, tuber closes, fever, cold, infections, body pains, etc., that effects the people to become ill health. These problems need to be taken care and help the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is not only the responsibility of government to improve the heath care sector but also, we&amp;nbsp;the citizens of our country can improve by maintaining cleanliness in the surrounding , planting more trees,&amp;nbsp;saving water, etc.,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In the&amp;nbsp;government hospitals&amp;nbsp;there are no proper rules followed by the doctors and patients regarding paying the bills, proper treatment, on time operations, maintenance of patients reports, etc., these things need to be improved by taking appropriate actions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There is more demand for private hospitals than government hospitals because private hospitals provide more facilities like receiving the patients with utmost care&amp;nbsp;and taking care of them till they are discharged but these hospitals charge more cash payment from patients, where as in public hospitals they are no proper care taken to patients, they charge low cash payments. hence&amp;nbsp;the rich people go for private hospitals and middle and low class people prefer government hospitals. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Hospitals like Osmania, Gandhi, Apollo,&amp;nbsp;etc., &amp;nbsp;are government and hospitals like Fernandez, care, etc., private hospitals these hospitals provide better facilities expert doctors, nurses, etc.,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government need to take measures to improve the globalisation, environment by planting trees, implementing safety programs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There is a saying that &amp;quot;prevention is better than cure&amp;quot; every one should take care about their health and think about their future life&amp;#39;s.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should bang the alcohol,&amp;nbsp;cigarette, biddy, etc.,&amp;nbsp;because they is more demand and supply for it. people are addicted to it, and have mental and physical problems.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should provide excellent education, by this our country&amp;nbsp;develops in the health care sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Thus I conclude the topic by saying that its not only the responsibility of the&amp;nbsp;government, but as we the citizens of our country can improve the health care sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
