Discuss with examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We are living in the digital age. In the present scenario every thing is working on numbers. With the invention of new technologies day by day it&amp;nbsp;Changed our imagination in the reality. We can now think of anything that we imagine in our dreams. Here Digitalization means any thing which&amp;nbsp;can work and controlled by numbers. We use binary numbers for this purpose. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Before the invention of aeroplane, no one was expected to fly like a bird in the sky but technology made it. Wireless phones Have taken the place of posts. With the help of emails , we can send any numbers of messages, documents and files in seconds. We can now talk to each others through&amp;nbsp; Skype Facebook and Gtalk. We can talk to our friends at any point of time when we wish all around the world. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India. The revolution of Information Technology Occurred in 1990&amp;#39;s when The then prime Minister of India Mr. Rajeev Gandhi allowed Computer in India. At that time many people opposed it because they thought it would take their job, but later they realised that how important it is for everyone. It has made our life very comfortable. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We can observe this digitalization everywhere for ex: When we go for transact money from ATM&amp;#39;s, By using a four digit number we can get as much money as we need. We have no need to go to the bank and stand for hours in a queue to get our money. We can buy any number of goods through&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; e-business. So these are some examples where we can see that how this digital technology&amp;nbsp; has changed our lives.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We also face through many frauds in our regular business regarding this online or digital services. Hacking is one of the worse activity in this field. People hack another account number and misuse it for their own benefit. To protect people from these frauds Indian government has passed Information Technology Act in 2002.Stringent action will be taken against those who will be found guilty of it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So, Finally I would like to conclude that Despite of some drawbacks this Digitalization has benefited us in a big way. None can live without this in the present scenario. It is very important part of life. We can say its a boon for us.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
