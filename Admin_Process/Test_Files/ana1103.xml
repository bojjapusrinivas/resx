What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India is a devolping country.India has underwent many transformations during the recent years.Inspite of acheiving good level of devolpment in economic, social,technological scenario still we are facing backdown in healthcare.There is a popular saying that &amp;quot;health is wealth&amp;quot;. It means that the person who is free from all health problems is considered as the most wealthiest.But today it is very impossible.Because due to changing life style and job scenario people are getting diseases at avery early age.And we need a proper health care system that cater to the health needs of the individuals.Though government has come up with many health policies still many are not getting proper treatment on time.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Our government has introduced many schemes like &amp;quot;arogyasri&amp;quot; and so on to provide good medical facilities to the poor people.In government hospitals they provide free medicine to the people.But it is very unfortunate that only some are able to recieve proper treatment.The people who reside in urban areas and in villages they are not able to get proper treatment.Because still today we see that there are no mediacal hospitals or any clinics in some border areas.And as a result they shouls travel to cities in order to get treatment.And some times if they have to travel long distance and if the problem is serious their lifes are lost until they reach the destination.And the people who live in villages due to lack of awareness also neglect their health problems and when they realise the problem &amp;nbsp;their health is out of their hands.The main reasons for enormous gap between health care supply and demand are as follows.In government hospitals we often see that the treatment is not provided on time to patients.And they do not give utmost importance to patient problems like in case of private hospitals.Ans even though government has come with good schemes for providing good health to their people still people are not able to reap benfits out of it. Because in order to make use of the schemes the individual should have a clear knowledge about these schemes which some may not have.And for schemes they have to fullfill certain formalities like submission of any valid proof which they may have or not.And if they do not fullfill the required formalities they will not be able to make use of the schemes.And we see that many political parties to protect their intrest and attract public they come up with many schemes. But in reality the implementation of these schemes is a doubt.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The major steps that should be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country are as follows.They should ensure that health facilities reach each and every individual of the country.And for this they should have a good working team.And they should give a chance to youth to be a part of the team.This would also help in solving employment problem.Government sould organise health clinics in urban areas. And they should&amp;nbsp; also be volunteers for each and every area so that he acts as intermediatary between the government and the individuals.And government should provide free medical facilities to the poor people.And they should ensure that it reaches them properly by apponting the suitable candidates.And government should also organise health campaigns regularly in villages and urban areas and create awareness about health problems to uneducated people.And if any one tries to make misuse of these schemes they should be severely punished.And if all these measures are properly followed then india will not only become healthy country but also devolped country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
