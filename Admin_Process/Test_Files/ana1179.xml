<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:29:13 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Points to be written about healthcare supply and demand&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;India:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I hope most of the Indian hospitals are neglecting in taking care of the patient&amp;#39;s because of the increased population and poor people in the country .western technologies are more faster than Indian technology but we couldn&amp;#39;t copy them India in today&amp;#39;s world is mostly threatening to bankrupt and India should allow the outside countries to make research about healthcare supply and demand in the country for its declines.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; By proper utilisation of natural resources patients can be improved and in today&amp;#39;s growing technology most of the villager&amp;#39;s are finding difficulty for not proving hospitals in their town or village Government &amp;nbsp;should take necessary actions to provide hospitals in each and every area of the country .by raising funds&amp;nbsp;or Taxes&amp;nbsp;across the world or the country Government can improve healthcare supply and demand in the Country . Government should provide better medicines and provide better treatment for the patients in the country and most of the foreigners are researching on how to cure cancer patients ,diabetic patients and&amp;nbsp;aids &amp;nbsp;patients but our India is still following the same medicines&amp;nbsp; but I hope India has to still improve its technology and by improving technology in he country it leads to effective supply and demand of the medicines and human resources.in today&amp;#39;s world most of the people are taking home made medicine&amp;#39;s compared to that of English medicines . &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By increasing the rate of the medicines poor people are facing problem to buy medicines which are of high cost and government by increasing number of private hospitals poor people are facing problems. Government should raise funds and taxes in the country by increasing them we can increase more number of Government hospitals. and the government hospitals should maintain clean and proper facility is needed and number of beds should be provided according to the patients in the hospitals. even they should see that doctor&amp;#39;s are providing necessary treatment to the patients. the hospitals should take about the patients more than the high&amp;nbsp; amount of the bill.&amp;nbsp; Get rid of artificial barriers more than the trained doctor&amp;#39;s, nurses and setting up hospitals. in India there is no shortage in supplying the products all the bottleneck&amp;#39;s are provided but similarly taking care of them is also important.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; Proper use of technology may lead to increased supply and demand of healthcare. Government doctors must treat their patients as the part of their family not as a business. In all the rural and urban areas government should provide hospitals to the poor people. all the surgeon&amp;#39;s doctors must be provided in each and every hospital&amp;#39;s. in today&amp;#39;s world Indian institutions are providing health care management as a part of student&amp;#39;s education by this India can improve the patient&amp;#39;s care in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
