<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;12/17/2012 2:28:37 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India&amp;#39;s economic matters, there is an excessive tendency towards the thinking rather than doing. Elaborate with examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India is marked by the presence of eminent scholars and economists. Despite this fact Indian economy has always been a subject to talk about and always been a headline maker. Why is it so? Why is India still a developing country?&amp;nbsp;These questions have always fascinated me. Indian policies and decision makers are respected all over the world because of their ability to forsee and apprehend corectly. During the global slowdown, India has shown considerably well in terms of&amp;nbsp;growth in GDP&amp;nbsp;when&amp;nbsp;most of the major economies had to succumb to the&amp;nbsp;effects of the meltdown. Thanks to our policy makers and economists who could saved the nation from the grip. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;However, despite all this India lacks somewhere. In taking economic decisions India is too slow. It cannot act aggresively. the system needs to be changed here. For an Act to be passed in the legislature the system shows a number of steps which takes&amp;nbsp;more than a year for that piece of legislature to be passed, not to talk about the implementation. This affects the economy. I would like to cite the example of the adoption of the&amp;nbsp; National Competition Policy. Competition Act 2002 which replaced the archaic MRTP&amp;nbsp; (Monopoly and Restrictive Trade Practice Act) is the piece of legislature which ensures that the market is working efficiently in a perfectly competitive environment&amp;nbsp;and no private or public entity is indulging in any sort of anti competitive trade practices. However this Act has certain loopholes or in&amp;nbsp;other words&amp;nbsp;proper provisions for certain acts or issues are not dealt with, therefore in order to deal with these discrepancies Commitee on National Competition policy proposed that a &amp;quot;Competition Policy&amp;quot; should be passed which will be a subset of the Competition Act. The centre comprising of eminent ministers and various policy makers appreciated the idea and agreed to pass the Bill. But it has been over&amp;nbsp;a year since the proposal is under consideration. Here India goes wrong. Why does it take such a long time to consider when it knows the Bill is for the betterment. Why does it takes so much time to think. Similar problem is with the Government Procurement Bill as well. It is under consideration as well since over a year. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Now the burning issue in the legislature&amp;nbsp; which is FDI in retails is announced after much consideration. It could have been anounced much earlier yet again the system delays the process. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is high time for India to reconsider its system. Rather than thinking, India should be proactive in deciding and announcing things. time should be cut down in thinking but more time should be spent in doing. India is definitely the next nuclear power provided it is more proactive in taking decisions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
