Please take a stand and discuss.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="2"&gt;In the Recent past we hear quiet a lot of discussions and debates on Government &amp;nbsp;high funding the IIT&amp;#39;s and IIM&amp;#39;s in comparison to the Primary Education .The question is quiet important for the educationists/Economists who believe &amp;nbsp;that Indian Economy growth depends purely on the Basic education provided at the school level. Like it is Rightly said that today&amp;#39;s Children are tomorrow&amp;#39;s future of Nation. However I strongly believe that both the children and Qualified Proffessionals are the pillars for the Nation&amp;#39;s Growth.Hence I believe equal funding is required for both the primary eduacation as well as prodcuing trained efficient world class professionals be it Management or in IT or any field is the NEED of the Nation .However the fact remains that Primary Education is negelected to an extent when compared to the Support Generated to Professioanl Education.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;I Strongly Believe that the Goverment has to Strike a Balance in Budgeting for both the Primary education as well as the reputed Tier 1 institutes an all career fields including IIM&amp;#39;s and IIT&amp;#39;s.To Support my view I would like to highlight few key reasons which influence my stand also why both the stages of education requires equal balanced approach of Budgeting and Planning.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Education&lt;/strong&gt; is the&lt;strong&gt; Pillar&lt;/strong&gt; for higher education for any student and it has to be provided with Quality .Now when I say quality it includes the&lt;u&gt; infrastructure ,Trained Teachers,Well designed Lesson plans &lt;/u&gt;and also providing exposure for further education with continous orientations on available careers rather the stereotyped Medicine and Engineering Industry which is still a Myth in backward families of the Country.Inorder to achieve the above described &lt;u&gt;&amp;quot;Good to have structure&amp;quot;&lt;/u&gt; definetly Indian government has to Fund Sufficently and in a Structured Manner with Consistent Checkpoints on final result as in measuring the Return on Investments periodically rather the fund not reaching the project at all.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Higher Educatio&lt;/strong&gt;n be it in any field does contribute to the great extent for the economy growth.Needless to say that today we are in an age where not Just Medicine,Engineering,management are the only available Career options ,Infact we have various fields of Fashion Designing,Media ,Education,Law etc who do and did Contribute to a large extent in bringing India to an international platform in the last couple of Decades.However IIT&amp;#39;s and IIM&amp;#39;s do play a signicant role in producing Year On Year Quality professionals with great offers from Multinational Companies as well as in producing Young &amp;nbsp;Business Tycoons in their fields and contributed signicficantly for the economy Growth.We have the recent epitome of New party Aam Aadmi Party Leader Arvind Kejirwal and whole lot of the members of the party who are also from these reputed institutes and who have come up with great zeal and enthusiasm to change the economy ,however I agree lot of idealogy of the Party is in Debate .But We should appreciate the young proffessionals who are from the leading institutes who championed the project to bring in Change by creating the AAP .This is just one of the recent examples I can quote of.However we also see lot of proffessionals who pass out from these insitutes prefer an opportunity Abroad rather than within the Country.Which is definetly individual choice ,however if strong value driven primary education was in place probably the percentage of proffessionals building careers and contributing &amp;nbsp;within the nation would have increased.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="2"&gt;We are aware of quality output of these institutes and inturn the proffessionals contribution but we also should ensure a similar strong foundation is provided for the Primary education as well. We witness there is Gap in funding to both these stages of Education ,But am sure if equal Budgeting and Vision is in place for both we can generate quality proffessionals who are value driven rather &amp;nbsp;than being driven by monetary benefits tagged to the career.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="2"&gt;I would like to conclude on the note that Education is like a chain it is our responsibility to make it a Value chain at each stage right from Primary till higher stage with quality and which is possible with equal contribution in Planning,Budgeting from the Government &amp;nbsp;to ensure we produce value driven proffessionals and build &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Incredible India&amp;quot; &lt;/strong&gt;for longlasting upper trend of economic growth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
