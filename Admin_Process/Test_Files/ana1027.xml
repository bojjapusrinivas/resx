What do you think are the major steps that can be taken in present circumstances to push growth in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YES!, the indian economy would bounce back from the present sitution, given some measures are at place,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The revival of the economy depends on the currency inflow in to the nation and the amount of services it generates, this can be essentialy done by easing the foriegn dorect investment norms presently in place, i am quite sure that the Indian government understands this an an essential economic booster which would potentially give employment to the hunger unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Few measures apart from taking measures to ease the currency inflow are &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;a) &amp;quot;Increase exports&amp;quot; as it is very useful to maintain the currency equation, the indian government decided to disinvest a part from the entities which it holds, so that the revenue generated would be put in companies which are in need of investment , At the present situation where in the indian government requires to pump in some money for BHEL, ISRO, BANKS(to follow BASEL norms), to keep the economy running on the growth path, though the rating agencies such are S&amp;amp;P and &amp;nbsp;CRISIL show a negative growth rate compared to the previous years, the recent entry of global tecnology, retail majors( WalMart,Facebook) &amp;nbsp;in to the indian soil, shows that there is a positive outlook &amp;nbsp;on indian investment from the global perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;b) &amp;quot;Self reliance on Oil&amp;quot; , Down the line this would be the crucial factor to control inflation, the Oil and Gas are the major influencers on the indian economy, this would influence all the exchange rates as well, so to maintain the growth at steady rate, being self reliant on a part of what the governent is importing will be a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;lastly, even tough the imports are reduced, the policies of imports and exports,FDI,FII are eased, if there is NO stable government structure,policies the faith in the investors reduces, pushing them away for better opportunities potentially away from India.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
