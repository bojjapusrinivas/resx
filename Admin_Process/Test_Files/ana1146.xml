Please take a stand and discuss.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Primary education is the key for every individuals growth in life. Only if, the foundation is good one would be able to progress in life. Literacy rate in India though being good there are many primary and secondary school dropouts. Most of the dropouts are girls, main reason for this scenario being lack of basic amenity such as washrooms. Ignorance of most of the rural population towards importance of education is yet another reason. Though this has been changing with the time much is needed to be done to increase awareness amongst people about importance of education.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Funding of government towards primary education should be increased. Basic amenities should be provided in every government school. There should be a strict vigilance on the teachers too as it is seen that most of the teachers though being enrolled in government school work for private schools and encourage people to join them. Private sector has overcasted government schools in the last few decades. Majority of the below poverty line population is still not in a position to afford private education. To improve their standard of living providing proper government sector educational institutions is required. Responsibility of the government extends beyond providing more and better primary education. It should be creating awareness among people about the facilities provided in the schools and advantages of being educated.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;Though government has introduced various schemes like mid day meals in government schools this has not yielded the results expected. This can be attributed to numerous reasons such as exploitation of the scheme by school employees to generate money for themselves, this is due to the lack of monitoring by government officials. In few schools such schemes are not at all practiced which again is due to lack of monitoring. So, monitoring of the schemes and usage of funds allocated is yet another important aspect to be focused on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Instead of focusing on IIts and IIMs and funding them governments area of focus should be primary education by doing many people would be able to avail the opportunity of getting educated. As as saying goes &amp;quot;Better the foundation strong the building&amp;quot;. Education epitomes like IITs and IIMs can fetch their funding from corporates too, instead of the funding provided by the government they have a huge fee structure wich is not even affordable by middle class section of the country. In such cases candidates manage loans from banks as many banks provide loans. But primary education is every ctizens right and only if that is funded more and developed &amp;quot;Right to education&amp;quot; clause by Indian constitution would be fulfilled. IITs and IIMs might give nation the best of all candidates with huge pay packages in the end but only proper primary education can give the nation best to all. The Number of IITians produced every year is outnumbered by number of children getting their right to education. So, instead of government focusing on improving a chunck of people&amp;#39;s standard of living it should be focusing on majority of people who are entitled to their right to education. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In most of the countries schooling is a free affair as government provides funding with the best quality education. Unlike, in India Education sector has been taken over by private sector which has made education a desire though it being a need. Government instead of funding big people and big names should be focusing on common man and on improving their standard of living which could be enhanced only by providing good primary education. Government should rethink its policy of shelling money on IITs and IIMs and focus on primary education which could serve major population in country than a few.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
