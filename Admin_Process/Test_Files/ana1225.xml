The automobile sales in the U.S. have seen a steep rise since 2012 due to the aging vehicles plying on the road and most importantly, the decreasing unemployment rate. While the average age of vehicles in 2012 was 10.8 years, by 2013 it rose to 11.3 years which was a commendable development for the industry.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Automobile sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% to the five year high of 14.5 million vehicles in 2012. By May 2013, auto sales in the U.S. grew by 8.2% to 1.44 million units. As per seasonally adjusted rate (SAAR), the automobile rate rose to 10.9% to 15.3 million units which indeed surprised the industry analysts. They opine that the easy lending and lower interest rates of banks to the automobile consumers played a significant role in the market recovery.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Economic Crisis in Europe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Global automakers in the European continent are worst hit due to the present Eurozone financial crisis. It has adversely affected the operations of the automobile makers who have a significant exposure to the market. The crisis has weakened the economy in turn making the consumer save for a rainy day than spend on automobiles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;This has drastically lowered the car sales in Europe to its lowest level of 12.05 million units in 2012 since 1995, indicating a year-over-year decline of 8.2%. The primary reason behind the decline has been sagging demand for cars and highly indebted banks were not keen to finance new car purchases for customers. Reuters opined that the decline was the steepest in the highly troubled Eurozone, dipping to 11.3% to roughly 9 million units.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Major automakers have decided to cut jobs and close the plants, as it has become tough for them to undertake full-fledged operations in the continent. As of March 2013, the unemployment headcount has reached 26.5 million, while the rate increased to 10.9% in the same month from 10.3% in March 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Ford was the first automaker planning to shut its vehicle and component plants in the U.K. and Belgium by 2016 while General Motors will suspend car production at its Bochum plant in Germany, which employs about 3,100 workers by 2016.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Renault is another big name in the automobile industry and plans to bring the jobs in France by 7,500 by 2016. Fiat and Peugeot and close to follow on the hells with a job cut of 1,500 respectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Japanese automakers, Honda has been closely monitoring the economic situation in Europe and plans to terminate 800 jobs at its South Marston plant near Swindon, Southwest England by the second quarter of 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don&amp;#39;t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18px"&gt;June 2013 - Auto Industry Outlook for the US and Europe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18px"&gt;U.S. Market Recovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18px"&gt;Strong pent-up demand due to aging vehicles on the U.S. roads along with falling unemployment rate have been the key factors in driving the auto sales in the U.S. Average age of vehicles on U.S. roads increased to 11.3 years in January 2013 from 10.8 years in 2012.
