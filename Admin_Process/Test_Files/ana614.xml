<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/23/2013 2:51:09 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current maxim is that the Internet knows everything about you. Do you think the Internet is invading your privacy?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 21st century is a world of gizmos and gadgets. With the advent of scientific research and modernization the world has shrunk. For instance,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a palm top is equipped enough&amp;nbsp;to bridge the distance between&amp;nbsp;your&amp;nbsp;uncle&amp;nbsp;in south america and your aunt&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;western australia. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;#39;Internet&amp;#39; has virtually transformed our everyday life. It has changed the way we look at the world and the way the world works.&amp;nbsp;Distance&amp;nbsp;is no longer a barrier between lovers.&amp;nbsp;You can talk and see your friends and family from any part of the globe through this amazing platform called the internet.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Friends are forever connected through facebook. A tweet here and a tweet there , and the world knows the kind of mood you are in. A&amp;nbsp;vacation in bali would not be as exciting had&amp;nbsp;one not had the chance to upload the most photogenic moments on&amp;nbsp;the fb&amp;nbsp;wall.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Companies would not have initiated the concept of work from home, had it not been&amp;nbsp;for the wonders&amp;nbsp;that the internet has to offer. Video conferencing&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;as common place as eating a sandwich.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Top directors, business honchos&amp;nbsp;close high value deals in a&amp;nbsp;matter&amp;nbsp;of minutes through skype.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We are almost living in a virtual world. Moods , expressions can now be communicated&amp;nbsp;with the click of a mouse to any one in the country, continent and the planet. Come to think of it, everthing has become so easy, so reachable. Long distance coversations have become so affordable. People can speak their heart out without having to bother about burning a hole through their pocket.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So, can we conclude that life has become simple? Uncomplicated ? That we are now relishing the joys of being tech&amp;nbsp;babies&amp;nbsp;and that we are actually carrying the world in our pockets in the form of smart phones?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The answer to this question may not be very easy to word. Because like every coin has a flip side, so internet also comes with an excess baggage. What is that baggage? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The baggage of never being alone. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The concept of privacy has taken a hit in a big big way. How you looked on saturday night last month after your break up is common knowledge. You had a break up is in itself common knowledge. Its posted , updated , tweeted , discussed , tagged , liked by people you know and even more by people you don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;nbsp;We don&amp;#39;t&amp;nbsp;even know the entire friend list on our&amp;nbsp;face book yet ironically,&amp;nbsp;they are friends.&amp;nbsp;We maynot even have seen them ever and yet we could be chatting with them every evening. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Initially this could be exciting , even great fun.&amp;nbsp;Yet slowly, it can get on your nerves. The fact that you are always being observed. Always being tracked. That your thoughts are being transmitted to the world even before you adjudge them yourselves. You can almost feel that your profile is a mirror reflection of your life. Your life is now on display. To the world. To the people. All the time. Anytime.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;To different people internet may mean different things. It could mean sharing the birth of your child with happines , frolick and photographs or it could mean having to suffer the unwanted public attention for just having a divorce. What happened, how it happened , when it happenend, everything is available on the net. A secret is no longer a secret.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;You specially plan a vacation to rishikesh to get away from the monotous and mundane work schedule and even in the mountains your phone is beeping constantly because there is some flaw in the presentation you prepared and you need to get it resolved on the spot. You are not alone. Your getaway plan is hampered. You are making business decisions even on the move. Your private time is being shared by one and all. You are being followed on your smart phone and your stress levels instead of getting low is getting to be all time high.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Such is modern day life. Such the power and impact of the internet. You are not alone. Personal space and time can sometimes be as distant as the moon.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Yet, can we do away with the internet? Can we really turn our backs on this symbol of advancement and globalization? I guess , none of us can. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The internet can be as devilish as it is exciting but it has now invaded our lives and our life styles very deeply. So much so that any kind of segregation is&amp;nbsp;no lonegr&amp;nbsp;possible. Hence,&amp;nbsp;the discretion to use it and tap it&amp;#39;s reach and potential to our advantage is vital. We need&amp;nbsp;to be judicious and cautious in ensuring that we donot become slaves of the tech world which we ourselves have created. Such that what was meant to be a tool for making lives simpler remains that ways. It bridges gaps rather than creating gaps. It fills us with a sense of unity rather than being divided. It creates families rather than breaking them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Internet is our creation. Merely a device developed by our race to enjoy the benefits of an easy life. It is meant for - Our use. Our convenience. Our ease. With that , lets raise a toast to internet and hope that it makes&amp;nbsp;the future more enriching and&amp;nbsp;simpler for&amp;nbsp;our generations to come.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
