The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the first five months of 2013, General Motors Company ( GM ) led with a 18.0% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. ( F ) with a 16.4% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. ( TM ) with a 14.2% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 11.7% market share, and Honda Motor Co. ( HMC ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( NSANY ) at the last spots with 9.5% and 8.1% market shares, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM&amp;#39;s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany&amp;#39;s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;OPPORTUNITIES &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To remain competitive, the automakers will need to design vehicles that will cater to consumers in both mature and emerging markets while manufacturing them at low-cost using the most advanced technology. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, Ford has undertaken &amp;quot;One Manufacturing&amp;quot; strategy, which aims at producing multiple models from plants across the world in order to save production costs and fast adaptation to changes in consumer tastes. The automaker anticipates producing 4.5 models at each of its plants by 2015, up from 3.6 models currently. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Further, the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features (which will save money on gas), even on the small and less gas-guzzler vehicles in order to attract buyers. The sale of optional features is helping them offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to large trucks. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The automakers continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. According to a study by CSM Worldwide, China and South America together will represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The role of governments is highly significant. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years. In late 2011, 13 major automakers, including Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Volvo, have signed letters of commitment with the U.S. Government to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
