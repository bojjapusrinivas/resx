<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:31:38 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I agree with the statement, which states about the gap between healthcare supply and demand. For understanding this, we need to check with the current health care system in India and its effectiveness. It is very clearly known that, In India, treatment in government hospitals is not as per standards. We will rarely see even a govt. employee working properly in his office. Even, the same is applicable for hospitality too. If we observe any govt doctor/nurse, who is providing his service in govt hospitals, they will never be poliete to patients. It will show their face to face arrogance towards others. we can&amp;#39;t say that it is because of their attitude, but we can say, it is because of the attitude they develop out of their jobs. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Some doctors, who are working in government hospitals, they will not respond to their patients properly, and will refer patients to some other private hospitals, in which they will be having private connection, or their wn clinics. This is none other than moving the patients to other hospitals, which will make them pay more money and will have their share from that.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Govt of India, though it has been taking many steps to reduce this, it keep failing for many years. As we all know, &amp;quot;ALL INDIANS ARE VERY GOOD PLANNERS IN THE WORLD, BUT COMES TO MERE IMPLEMENTATION, THEY SUCCEED RARELY&amp;quot;. The statement itself giving an idea about how good are Indians in planning, but coming to implementation, it will not happen much easily. Reforms, which we provide for any sector are well and good, but the way we utilise them ultimately gives the result. That&amp;nbsp;means, implementation must be well superwized than what we plan. There are many other things, which we succeed in planning, but fail in implementing. Healthcare sector, comparitively many other sectors is in a little better position. Government need to take many steps, inorder to reduce the gap between healthcare supply and demand. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Out govt will take many measures for implementing their ideas, but continuously fails. It may be because of some people, who are habbituated for bribing, and the others who support them. There were many situations in India, like, if a person did not accept for having bribe to do a crime, he will be sentenced to death. People with this kind of nature will not be helpfully encouraged, but will surely be punished for their activities of this kind. Coming to healthcare supply and demand, it also consists of many branches, which could be able for the purpose of watching the health of all citizens of India, which may help in increse of health and increase average life span of people. But for this, the doctors should be given strict instruction, in which, about the treatment and how good they will respond to patients.&amp;nbsp; In this process, they may need to keep many things aside.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Govt of India can take many steps for increasing the average life span by rising up several rules to doctors. Thos should be fixed conditions and the people who crosses these conditions will ne sentenced to death or imprisoned, so that, this kind of behaviour will be able to increase the&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; efficiency in people and also fear in doctors. Doctors, who working in any govt hospital, should not work in any other hospitals, all govt hospitals should be well infrastructured, no patient who came to govt hospital must not be referred to any other hospital or clinics, sothat they will be well treated there. This may help the nation, to create its own income and keep it in by itself. The illness percentage will not raise and will be supportful for India, so that it can invest more in our economy and develop our nation with our own money. These kind of factors can be taken by govt to reduce gap between healthcare demand and supply in India. Otherthan these, it has to start educating people, to go to govt hospitals for treatments. Now a days, it has been seing that, people are trying to understanding things, and this will help to develop healthcare sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
