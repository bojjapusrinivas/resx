<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;2/1/2014 11:31:08 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that there is an enormous gab between healthcare supply and demand.Even though in India we have many hospitals who are providing good services to public.but some where around we are lacking behind in satisfying the needs of patients&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;for eg,if there is an emergency i.e, if a person has met with an accident then in the hospital instead of providing firstaid to that person the hospital staff tells the person to fill the form or if required they will also make the patient to wait until police reaches the spot. This is one of the major problems that takes place in Indian hospitals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;In order&amp;nbsp;to avoid&amp;nbsp;this problem Indian government should take the following steps.They are as follows:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Government should remove all the rules which makes the patient to wait untell police come.I agree even the legal proceidings are important .But patient&amp;#39;s health is also important therefore,immediate relief must be provided to people and then police must be allowed to carryon with there procedinds.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;In India the next problem we face is ,the medicines here are very expensive which most of the people can&amp;#39;t afford.so therefore care must be taken that medicines &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;are sold at reasonable prices.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;In most of the villages in India we&amp;nbsp;hardly find any multi speciality hospitals. we only find Government hospitals there with no necessary medical facilities.Therefore,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Indian Government make sure that there must be an multi speciality hospital in villages.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;One of the major problems the Indian government is facing&amp;nbsp;is that of the strikes .which are generally called by junior doctors at times senior doctors as well. Therefore, government should&amp;nbsp;steps to satisy both the junior doctors as well as senior doctors by providing some incentives etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;In most of the hospitals we don&amp;#39;t find necessary arrangements like there will be only one I.C.U. Or there will not be any seating arrangement.if a person is suffering from contagious disease then that person is allowed to share the room with other people if there are no sufficient rooms. By doing so it is also effecting the other person. Therefore, care must be taken&amp;nbsp;by the government to provide adequate space in hospitals for&amp;nbsp;the patients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;I am glad that in India, now a days we find many medicines which can cure dangerous disease &amp;nbsp;like Cancer, Braintumer etc. But&amp;nbsp;with the changes in environment, the Indian government must take steps to&amp;nbsp;make hospitals to be updated with the changes in medicines etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Advertisement&amp;nbsp;campaign&amp;#39;s should also be provided&amp;nbsp;in order to create awareness among people regarding dangerous disease and the medicines which are available to cure the disease.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;In villages we hardly find educated people .so because of this reason,&amp;nbsp;the government should make advertisements&amp;nbsp; regarding medicines&amp;nbsp;in the language which is known to them .Rather than advertising in English.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Many people relate to film stars, television stars or any public figure or sports person. Therefore , in order to appeal to public. Advertisements regarding medicines must be made with these stars. which will also create awareness among people regarding medicines. Recently I have seen&amp;nbsp;an ad&amp;nbsp;wherein actress Amala better known as wife of Nagarjuna. Has&amp;nbsp;created awareness among women&amp;nbsp;who are pregnant about what&amp;nbsp;to be followed during pregnancy what are the tests that must be undertaken etc. By seeing this ad I hope,&amp;nbsp;atleast&amp;nbsp;75&amp;nbsp;% of women are&amp;nbsp;aware about what to follow during pergnency.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;We hardly have some 4-5 medical stores which operate 24*7 daily. which are located in city and we don&amp;#39;t even find medical stores operating 24*7 in villages. Therefore, the government of India should take steps to make sure that the medical stores should run 24*7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Hospitals should also create friendly environment which will satisfy the needs and wants of public.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Therefore ,finally I would like to conclude by saying that&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot; HEALTH IS WEALTH&amp;quot; and it is the duty of each and every citizen of India to be updated with the changes that are taking place in each and every place of world and it is also the duty of government to create awareness among people regarding medicines and also to provide necessary information regarding harmful disease.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; THANK YOU.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
