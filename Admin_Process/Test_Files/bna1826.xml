<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/9/2015 5:28:03 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical care is a basic necessity of citizens, but people are mostly concerned about their well being and not that of the others. Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Being healthy than wealthy is more important to a human being. As a human being,each and every person in this world want to lead a healthiest life with their families. Hence a proper medical care should be taken to prevent health issues in the future. In my views, in India a proper medical services are not provided&amp;nbsp;for example, let us take a recent health issue which have taken place in Andhra Pradesh i.e. swine flue , vaccination was not provided to people well in advanced&amp;nbsp;because of which so many have lost their lives even when government knows that their are multiple seasonal diseases spreading,instead government have responded when the issue have become serious i.e. after death of tens of people and&amp;nbsp;hundred`s of people have got the disease as it is a easily spreadable disease. The main reason&amp;nbsp;behind this negligence is government&amp;nbsp;is busy in fighting with other government about funds released to them. They are concerned about their wealth than peoples health who have voted and elected them as their leaders. Still the government response to this issue is very poor they are providing vaccination to people at cost which is suppose to be to people with no cost. Hospitals which are supposed to serve the people have become commercial and selling the vaccine to people at their own cost (i.e.&amp;nbsp; Rs 450-Rs.750 )which results to the death of poor people as they cannot afford to take precaution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;As the cost is affordable by higher and upper middle class people they are getting vaccine easily&amp;nbsp;and saving their lives instead people should take responsibility so that vaccine is provided to every one at no cost. Swine flue is just an example which we consider, still their are many seasonally spreadable diseases in India like bird flue hence government should take well in advance precaution to save life of people,as we all know that "Prevention is better than Cure"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Apart from this hospitals should conduct a frequent medical camps to create awareness in people about health and diseases specially in rural areas.In this program doctors should explain about cleanliness and how to keep their surrounding clean and also explain the steps to be taken immediately when any person get ill. Government should encourage hospitals to provide free services to lower class people as they cannot afford the cost of treatment and also should introduce special scheme for&amp;nbsp;them. Introducing a scheme is not a big issue but government should also have frequent&amp;nbsp;inspection about how the scheme is working and how people getting benefits from the scheme or any loop hole are taking place. Government have taken the&amp;nbsp;first step and are conducting several awareness programs and also advertisement in the television about cleanliness.A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;second step should be taken by ach and every individual and see that our surrounding are clean and green and also discuss about the issues in their respective community meeting and take precautions well in advance to avoid health problems in the future&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
