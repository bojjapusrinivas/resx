Discuss with examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the comparison arise between the digital age and the age before that with the huge inventions and many discoveries in our lives, we must say our lives are having a dangerous point towards the peaceful lives. Here is a basic example; when the family and relationships are compared, previously we used to have macro families and large number of people in the family but now so called the digital age there only the micro families existing.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Many of the children at present are been addicted to the internet and &amp;nbsp;social networking websites, where they are loosing interest towards the studies and gaining unnecessary access towards the activities which partly may increase their knowledge &amp;nbsp;but not the required knowledge to that extent of age children.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; when we talk about the modern inventions the people are lacking to have the peaceful&amp;nbsp; life, the more the new inventions the more an individual will be stressed because presently the market is looking for the people who efficient and as well as effective but when these new inventions or the new technology takes place, For a short span of time a person will not be adjusted properly and where there is chance to commit the mistakes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Finally as per to my knowledge and opinion I conclude that the digital age at present which tremendously making changes in our lives, may make the work more easier but the personal lives might get disturbed partly.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
