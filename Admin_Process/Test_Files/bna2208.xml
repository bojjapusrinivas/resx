Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clean India is one of the ongoing movement in our country. Basically clean India is all about the greenary , less wastage of the food and a clean society. But the point here to be noted is that clean India is a movement started in order to make India clean and green. The roads, railway stations, bus stations and all other public places should be kept clean. The basic idea behind this movement is to get awareness among the pepole as &amp;nbsp;a whole irrespective of their class, caste and standard of living. This emphasise mostly on the areas where there is a huge movement of crowd on a daily basis.The government has come up with various initiatives regarding clean India. But there is also a equal part of the public to make it a success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The movement was started in few areas of the country like metropolitan cities, towns and other special economic zones. The SEZ`s are the areas or zones where there is huge development.This development of SEZ `s increase the economic growth of the country.So special care have to be taken to make the areas in the cities and towns for a better success of the movement.The SWACH BHARAT is also one of the inititaive taken by &amp;nbsp;our Prime Minister Narendra Modi to see to clean India by 2020.The programme was implemented in many cities of the country.But there is still far to go in respect of clean and green India. All the programmes which are implemented are acted upon on behalf of the government rules and regulations. If there no exists any Government in the country there wont be any programs as which. Therefore there should be strong initiation from the government itself before the public acts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Making the programmes as such is very good for the country`s growth.But how far this movement is successful is yet to be known.Making people aware is the first step of any government policy.Introducing the program does`nt alone will work out.How well the program has reached to the public is more important for its success.India is Democratic country.There is Right to Information in our fundamental rights.Hence the responsibilty of the government and its members to give the right and useful information regarding any policy,program,rules and regulations to the public in the first hand.Without the consent of public and their interest, the government cannot take initiative which can either influence the people in the wrong way or it can become an issue against the public interest.Therefore,the government has to appoint new comittees to give information to the people and make them aware of what is going on in the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The second step, after making people aware of the program,is to take action in regard of the program initiated.Making people aware is not enough there should be a strategy in making that plan into action.The strategy can be decided by public themselves, which will be according to their own interets or it can be implemented by the government in the interest of public.The change of the attitudes of the public is the main concern for any government in the world. In any country the public are the main actors in all aspects of the country irrespective of the economy,government in force etc.,. So in order to implement any program the government should keep in mind the attitudes,preferences and interest of the people in that country.The attitude has to be changed inthe public regarding Clean India. It is not just a movement, it is the future of our country.The attitude change is more important than the movement because everything that goen on in the country is based on the people in that country.How the people react to the changes in the country is more important than the changes that take place outside the country.The actions of the public shows whether they have accepted the initiation or not.The government should not force the public in regard of such things.There should be a initiation from the public themselves as it is for the health and safety of the public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Therefore, the government has to maintain direct contacts with the public regarding the Clean India program.The responsiblities and duties of the public should be given like to keep the roads and our premises clean,every home should have a bathroom facility,the waste should be thrown in the garbage etc.,. Swach Bharat and similar other programs should be implemented to make India clean and green.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Clean and Green India should be the motive for every citizen of the country.....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
