What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. There is a lot demand for healthcare services and the supply is less. There are many number of people who are getting affected with different of diseases and are not able to get healthcare services on time. There are many villages in which there is no proper healthcare services.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Now-a-days medicines are discovered for many deadly diseases, but many of them are not aware of the medicines discovered and are also&amp;nbsp;not able to get the medicine to them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There&amp;nbsp;is cure for cancer but many of them are not aware of this. So many people are getting affected with cancer and becoming victims of it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There are many government hospitals which run for name-sake. There is no proper treatment to the patients. Reasons may be many like lack of proper facility, lack of medicines, lack of doctors, doctors negligence etc..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Many people in the country are dying due to lack of proper healthcare services. So, g&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;overnment should take neccesary steps to improve patient care in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I think healthcare can be improved by taking the following steps. They are as follows&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should give strict rules to hospitals to provide proper healthcare services to the patients, and every activity of the hospitals should be recorded in system.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should conduct awareness session to the people regarding the diseases which are very dangerous and also provide sessions on health care that need to be taken by them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should pass strict rules to the government hospitals that every employee should complete their shift timings as per the scheduled shift rather than coming leisurely at whatever time they want, as many of the poor people who depend on government hospitals are not able to get proper medicines as the treatment is given by the nurse or compounder of that hospital due to the absence of doctor.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should provide mobile healthcare services so that patients get treatment at areas in which they are located.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should make sure that all the medicines reach to the government hospitals. As there are cases where corrupt doctors sell them to others.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As the population is increasing very much government is not in a situation to provide medicines to all of them. So goverment should provide free family planning services to the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If the population is in control, government can provide healthcare services to almost all the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If the government can provide some awareness to people regarding the diseases, atleast few of them can be saved from diseases.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should provide healthcamp twice in every month to rural areas so that services are provided to rural people also.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Strict Invigilation shoud be done in hospitals to check if proper treatment is provided and proper medicines are given.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If government takes some steps gap between healthcare supply and demand can be reduced.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
