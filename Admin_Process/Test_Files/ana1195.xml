What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introduction:In India Health care system has been developing Day by Day but because of sum particular reasons their supply for hospitals were has been Reducing That&amp;nbsp;is the main reason for&amp;nbsp;Hospitals to avoid that government should avoid the doctors who are visiting from the other Countries now-a-days Many institutions are coming in&amp;nbsp;to the competition and to increase&amp;nbsp;the health care management system to attain their&amp;nbsp;best in the country,the government should attain some&amp;nbsp;rules&amp;nbsp;and regulations so&amp;nbsp;that it has&amp;nbsp;been easy to attain better position&amp;nbsp;in this global competitive world.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Body: Health care Management &amp;nbsp;system in&amp;nbsp;India has been&amp;nbsp;improving but the government should take the major&amp;nbsp;rules regulations like&amp;nbsp;they must provide more and more institutions with our country students so they can develop the health care management system, There must first&amp;nbsp;develop the&amp;nbsp;rural areas there are&amp;nbsp;only&amp;nbsp;one or two hospital in a villages, Government should take certain actions that for developing their&amp;nbsp;Villages by providing the&amp;nbsp;health care management system and they also should provide aware&amp;nbsp;of people about the&amp;nbsp;health care&amp;nbsp;Management system&amp;nbsp; so,&amp;nbsp;the people coming to know about their particular requirements in their villages.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should also &amp;nbsp;make to provide an number of institutions for the improvement and also helpful for the reducing demand for particular subjects.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The government should also provide medical check up&amp;#39;s for the people for an&amp;nbsp;alternative basis.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;they also should also should provide online basis process for the providing better facilities for the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;India&amp;nbsp;there are very less health care management process because of that the&amp;nbsp;process cannot move forward&amp;nbsp;to avoid that the government should&amp;nbsp;provide free&amp;nbsp;training for the&amp;nbsp;nurse and also provide permanent growth for&amp;nbsp;jobs in certain hospitals so that they&amp;nbsp;can achieve their certain goals for the institutes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Their must be an take an initiative by the government to take up this part for reducing the demand for the institutions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;conclusion : My view for this major topic the Government should provide an huge number of institute so they can reduce their demand for the supply for the institutions, they also should provide an number of institutions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
