Elaborate with examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that in economic matters,there is a tendency of thinking more than doing in india.in goverment sector, a lot of factors are resposible for this.one is red tapism.there is a lot of planning done and a lot of time is spent in planning.the plan is made with resourceful people including economists,bureaucrats and others with a considerable amount of time and money spent on it but when it comes to the implementation of the project, there comes to be seen a lot of discrepancies in it.the execution of the project is done&amp;nbsp; poorly&amp;nbsp;in some cases and very poorly in some others.the reason for this is that the government servants and the staffs in the lower hierarchy get indulged in filling their own pockets.they start to make their own shares in the money which is meant for public welfare.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A recent example is of a govt. health project in u.p.it came to light that a lot of indiscrepancies occured in this project.the people who were meant to get the benefits reported that they did not get it.it was a big project.so a&amp;nbsp; lot of money went in the pockets of the middlemen who were responsible for implementing it.a CBI probe confirmed this.another big project running for the the employment of rural poors is MNREGA.a lot of people are getting benefit from it and its effective implenentation is to be ensured.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; one project that is currently running for the literacy of children in the age group of 6-14 years is SARVA SIKKSHA ABHIYAAN(SSA).under this project children get midday meals and some other benefits like school uniforms,scholarship grants etc.some reports say that in some parts of the country ,children are not getting the food as listed in their menu or the quality is poor.teachers are not ensuring the correct implementation of the programme.they make some of their own benefit out of it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;in this way many goverment projects are running at state and central level.these projects are huge and are meant directly for the people.but the eneffective implementation of it makes it a unsuccessful affair.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;another problem that appears is that econmists and analysts does a lot of thinking work.but they try less to act on some of their plans.even if they some of action on their thinking ,some people would get the benefit.burden on government would lessen.they may start some of their own projects involving people and can drive forwards.they should not be dependent on government bodies for every start up and action.common people would also learn about a model.many enterpreneurships work have been successfully started by common as well as resourceful people and made a big success.some of the IT companies like infosys,wipro are examples of this.Dabbawalla in mumbai,Amul milk project started by latr dr. kurien are examples of enterpreneurship started by common men.knowledgable and resourceful people must help those who want to start something.only then their knowledge and money can be best utilized .problems like unemployment and poverty would reduce.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;the govt would also have to ensure that their project gets implemented smoothly.the corrupts should be punished and thrown out of it.we have enough resources and money.only this thing is to be seen that they reach to the beneficiaries and do not go&amp;nbsp;the hands of middlemen.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Govt. can do public-private partnership&amp;nbsp;to make some projects and ensure its timely and proper implementaton.in our country a lot of businessmen and industrialists have got huge amount of money.with their help some projects can be started for the public and its implementation and monitoring can be put in hands of private people.narayanmurti of infosys left his lucrative job&amp;nbsp;there and helped govt. to start and complete the AADHAR project.many other such initiatives are expected from them.private companies are fulfilling their social resposibilities in form of CSR.they are helping in development of villages,building of schools,hospitals,roads etc.development of all sections of people is to be thought of.only then inequalities would reduce.shiv nadar of HCL started an university and schools to help the society&amp;nbsp;in overcoming illiteracy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;in developed countries the gap between thinking and acting is less.they have enough material resources and technology to act on their plans.corruption in governance is also lesser.we can overcome this deficiency to some extend by involving our young tecnnical people to work.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;we&amp;nbsp;are producing a large number of tecnical and management graduates every year from our universities.they&amp;nbsp;would have to apply the theoretical knowledge in the practical ground.they should work with the common people and use their hands as well without being dependent much on the government.in this way the tendency of excessive thinking can give way to action.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
