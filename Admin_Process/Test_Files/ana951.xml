Companies which are into furniture and paper industries are cutting down the trees (Deforestration) and very few companies like ITC are thinking of it and giving back to society with scheems like Shikha and ITC also started aforestration which is a very good idea. ITC is thinking of the environment while doing its business which many other companies are not doing. So this practise of aforestration must be adapted by all the companies which are cutting down the trees, so that it may help the future generation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Go Green: Industries are coming up with &amp;quot;Go Green &amp;quot; campaings which is a good sign for the environmental protection. Usage of plastic and other things which are not good for the environment are being banned and alternatives are also coming up for plastic bags. So people must think of it and avoid using things like plastic bags which are harmful for the environment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Pollution is one of the main things that are spoiling the environment. To control pollution Automobile Industries have launched Electric bikes which do not pollute the environment.India is the one of the largest importer of petrol and diesel. If people in india start using these electric bikes India need not imports such huge quantity. &amp;nbsp;Automobiles do not contribute the most to air pollution, its Industries which leave gases are the most which are polluting. To eliminate it what they have to do is just follow the instructions which are given by the pollution control board like, they have to leave the waste gasses above certain height by constructing chimneys.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If its only about acceleration of development then developing countries like India &amp;nbsp;should encourage or allow more and more SME&amp;#39;s and MSME&amp;#39;s into the economy. MSME&amp;#39;s are &amp;nbsp;less in number as of now but in the coming few years SME&amp;#39;s and MSME&amp;#39;s are going to become huge assets for our country. They are going to be the one which contributes most to the GDP. India must have a its currency stable which means Rupee against Dollar is very volatile so the RBI had to change its policies to control the Rupee depreciation and inflation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Its very hard for countries which are into scams of crores and deeply in courruption to grow. So if India should grow, no one should be courrupt and should not do any scams. If every Rupee earned is into the accounts then there would be scope for growth, but here in India its is not the situation. Politicians , Businessmen and many more are having Crores of black money which are not in accounts. So I beleive when every individual is perfect in their accounts and pay the taxes on time and if Government uses the money for development of India then India and developing countries like India will definitely grow.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
