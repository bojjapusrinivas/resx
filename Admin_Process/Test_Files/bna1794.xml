<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/9/2015 5:26:51 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical care is a basic necessity of citizens, but people are mostly concerned about their well being and not that of the others. Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medical&amp;nbsp; care is one of the basic things where a person is required in the present scenario where many people are having many health complications at very younger ages. Medical care has become a commercial and money making&amp;nbsp;industry &amp;nbsp;rather than concentrating on the wellness of the patient&amp;nbsp;. When comparing India with other developed and developing countries we are in very less position in number in medical care. India is a country where we invented Ayurveda, Homeopathy, where a disease or an illness can be cured effectively with out any&amp;nbsp;health hazards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;India is offering only&amp;nbsp;4% of the income of its budget to medical care , where as other countries like USA, Canada are offering 10% to 15% of their national budget on medical care. Commercializing the medical care will be a big burden for the citizens in countries like India because of their economical status. In India&amp;nbsp;60% of population a still depending&amp;nbsp;up on&amp;nbsp;agriculture where the economical status is very less when compared to other sectors. Governments like Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh etc. have taken their initiatives by&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;offering Health cards up to 3,00,000 rupees for the people who are cant able to afford the expenses . But it has taken in to wrong paths by the private hospitals and corrupted politicians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Medical care should not be commercialized, rather than that government has to utilize the abundant resources we are having in the form of medical graduates and make them to work for society not for the sake of money. Their is clause&amp;nbsp;, where a medical student has to promise to work in a rural and remote area&amp;nbsp;after the course has completed, but it not getting implemented. Due to&amp;nbsp;opportunities available in this global world medico`s are&amp;nbsp;shifting to abroad countries to pursue their carriers. By providing a perfect platform to them, government can be add a benefit to the medical care and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;also can make India as medical destination. Because many countries a depending on India for the drugs that are manufactured in India and utilizing the resources we are having, "what if India can utilize the same resources for it self?", we will be the leaders in the word. We cant say that people are mostly concerned about their well being because the recent incident in India like Heart Transplantation for 23 year old boy where Police and the Donors have&amp;nbsp; co-operated with the doctors to give him a second life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Depending more on commercialized medical care it may effect the medical condition of the country due to because of the cost incurred in it. Better not to commercializing the medical care, if government has offered the health policy scheme like as in USA it will be effective and generate economy to the country. If the citizens are healthy they can work more and they can create more revenue. So that India can increase its economy. by providing health insurance policies to the citizens by the government itself it will be trusting factor for the citizens to get benefit for those policies. As India is growing in its populations size there will be burden in each and every industry , so by taking the necessary precautions by the government and not making medical care commercialization it will helps in many ways in terms of social and economical conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
