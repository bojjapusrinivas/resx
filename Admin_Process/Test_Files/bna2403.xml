&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Ans. India is now at the era of Digitalisation. The Respected Prime Minister of India Sri Narendra Modi is striving alot to make India the best, he want the India to become a noticable and well known country in the world. The India is a country where people believe in ethics, culture, superstitions and regional attachments. So it is not easy for anyone to change the attitude of Indians, but the thing is that we are listening only one word since we are born that is `India is a developing country` why India is still developing country there are many reasons we are ranking second in population and last in richness. We got independence in 1947 means around 70 years are passed but we are still in developing era only.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The only reason tje other countries who got indepence later than us like germany are developed because they were emphasizing there skills on digitaliastion and development of the country, they did many revolutions to develop there are country in terms of economy, industrialisation and knowledge. In India the literacy rate is so less why because people are unaware of fact that if they are educated means they`ll get good life, even though after knowing the importance some people who are below the poverty line those kids are not sent school they send as a child labours for any construction works and hotel workers, because they are in want of food than education.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;However the concept is about bullet train i think this would increase our prestige in the world, that would be good if the government is encouraging the development of metro and developed cities in India. The pros of the concept is that the country can show its development to the world and the people who are living in cities they feel the comfort of life. And the sophisticated developments make them encouraging to show their standard of living. Though the country is best possible for all the developments that could be made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;India`s primary sector is Agriculture and secondary and tertiary are industries and factories, so the government is keen about the secindary and tertiary sector. The government announced that they are going to make a smart cities, they selected some of the cities and made a list of requirements over their and they want ot develop those cities where they are lack of facilities or infrastructure. As part of Digital era they are making the initiation of metro trains and bullet trains in those cities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Coming to the main concept of Bullet Train, the train is may be required in highly developed cities like delhi, banglore and chennai. I can say if those cities are also in need of bullet train or not the government before initiating this they have to conduct a survey whether people are willing to have them are not. Other than those cities all cities are now striving to get developed so they just need better trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The India`s situation is that first the government should focus on Literacy, poverty and proper infrastructural facilities. And the most important thing is that the India is Agriculture based country so it shoukld concentrate on helping farmers and providing proper facilities and should educate them regarding new techniques of production, So these all are needs of India the government should focus on all the areas of development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The digitalisation is required to the country, But according to maslow`s need hierarchy theory bullet train fall under self esteem need so before that the country should be fulfilled by Baisc needs, Secuirty needs, and society needs. So i wish if government understands this concept so they must focus on better trains for india not bullet trains, I can make list of manyu cities and villages who are not having railway junctions and even a railway mode to travel, leave about trains till now their are many villages who are not having proper roadways. People are still struglling for travelling so the government should overcome the problems from ground level and then concentrating on digitalisation would give good results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;So currently India is in need of better trains. Recently in two three places the train accidents were happened that may becuase of improper railway tracks, less interest of railway workers or maybe because of poor signals. So presently it should concentrate on those situations why all those are happening frequently. And in India there is common thing that happens with train is delays. If our journey is scheduled at particular time means who dont know whether the train comes fast, before the time. This happens because of poor signals. So the government should focus on providing better sigbnalmfacilities and better trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;I am not against to Bullet train, If really the government want to digitalise the India then they should fulfill the basic needs of the country and provide proper or better trains for the eligible villages and cities and as i mentioned above it can implement the bullet train for metropolitian cities. I am also eager to hear the word that India is a developed country, but i think so it may take few more years. Now-a-days the government implementing many schemes to pull of the black money that has been hided, if they succeded to get back all the black money and if really political system works well in India means that would be boon for India. We can see a corruption free Digitalised and Developed India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
