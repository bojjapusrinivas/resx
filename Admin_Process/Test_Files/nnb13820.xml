Discuss the positives and negatives of India&amp;#39;s political system.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my opinion now a days political system became too worst. The politicians are became selfish persons in the country.. They are not take care about the people who is living and who is depends on them.. now a days the politicians does not know how to rule the country are what ever.. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;politicians are thinking about the person and their family.. In this some people are there in the political system who is working for the people. In the political system the persons who is working for the people does not have a correct chances to work in the political system....&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;there &amp;nbsp;is no positives in the political system or politicians because they cannot control the people who is destroying the other people lives and the system does not punish that type of people in correct way.. they cannot help the poor people in the country.. they looks at high position only. Actually this is my opinion about the political system.Now a days the politicians or any other person cannot control or overcome the crimes in the country.The political system one of the reason for the backwardness..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
