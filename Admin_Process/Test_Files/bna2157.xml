<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3/9/2016 2:21:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To inculcate the spirit on entrepreneurship in India, the Government launched &amp;lsquo;Start-up India&amp;rsquo; initiative in January 2016. Do you think this initiative would be a historic moment in ushering the era of economic prosperity in India. Please elaborate with reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I would think Start-Up India is an dynamic initiative from the Government of India, this initiative will not only help in the economic growth of our country but will also help in generating jobs and check unemployment. The timing of this initiative by the Government is more appropriate as we have lot of unemployment in the sections of skilled and unskilled workforce. &amp;nbsp;This scheme is also linked with banks for financing the entrepreneur.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="apple-converted-space"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;This scheme for financing in the bank is called as Mudra Yojana. Through this scheme any entrepreneur can avail a bank loan for his business project, the amount of loan would be up to 10,000,00 rupees depending upon the project. &amp;nbsp;The highlight of this loan is that it is issued by banks against no collateral security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, for any scheme from the Government there are a lot of hurdles in terms of acquiring licenses, capital finance etc. &amp;nbsp;The Government should look into this formalities becoming easier for the entrepreneur and help him to reduce much time from the Idea of business time to actually starting the production. &amp;nbsp;Even though this is an good initiative from the Government other helps such as place for the business, machinery for the business, infrastructure of the city should be provided initially at subsidized prices. &amp;nbsp;I would also suggest that Government should start some type of counselling office`s or center`s where experienced business experts should help the new entrepreneur by giving him expert suggestions. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The scheme also has involvement from the other party which is the beneficiaries of the scheme, these beneficiaries should first and foremost consider this scheme as an positive help from the government and work hard towards making his own project successful. &amp;nbsp;Some of the beneficiaries might take this opportunity to exploit the scheme and abscond with the banks money, which is very dangerous as this will make Government to reconsider the scheme. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Hence I think Start-Up India is an much good initiative taken by the Government of India. &amp;nbsp;But to make the Scheme successful all the parties such as Government officials, Banks, Business experts, beneficiaries should work towards the common goal, which is making India economically strong and generating much needed jobs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market growing towards significant modernization as the demand for smart elevator which are fast, comfortable, efficient, secure along with standard requirements for worldwide green infrastructure is the need of the hour for existing and new structures of high rise buildings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;The demand in developing Asian countries is very high such as, China which has around 53 percent high rise projects around the world would grow significantly, which in turn could takeover modernization revenue by 2020.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The developed countries such as US, UK, Canada, France have been contributing to the market of modernization of elevator system. Therefore in future upcoming high rise buildings would contribute more than 52% to overall smart elevators market revenue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;The smart elevators with its technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication , access control and security technology,&lt;span class="apple-converted-space"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort&amp;nbsp;and ability to customize as per requirement finds demand in various end-users such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;The number of people residing in cities has changed to 54 percent in 2014 from 34 percent in 1960. &amp;nbsp;The estimates suggest 1.8% growth every year. &amp;nbsp;There would be vertical growth due to limitations of geographical expansion giving way for high rise projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;Global vendors, to remain competitive are shifting to smart elevators. ThyssenKrupp which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators uses cloud capable systems to gather valuable data about systems and sensors and to improve its service. &amp;nbsp;In 2014 Schindler Elevator Corporation modernized its port elevator technology at Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico, this company also installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system in&amp;nbsp;The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas&amp;nbsp;. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;The commercial application of smart elevators is very vast and designed according to its usage. &amp;nbsp;Such as residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic compared to commercial building hence capacity of passenger varies, whereas healthcare sector need deeper elevators to take stretchers. &amp;nbsp;In malls, multiplexes, retail and warehouses requires spacious and ride comfort elevators designed by vandal proof material. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The giant players are working on innovating solutions for elevators that would consume less power and provide same customer experience. &amp;nbsp;For example Mitsubishi developed multi elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption up to 10%, this technology focuses operational efficiency during peak hours of rush at the same time maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
