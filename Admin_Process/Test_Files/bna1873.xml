Do you think this brain drain is making the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer? Discuss the pros and cons of brain drain, and measures to check this phenomenon? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I as an individual grateful to speak on the article "Qualified people from developing countries move to developed or rich countries in search of a better position, profile, work &amp;nbsp;and money". For any article will be having both pros and cons to express one`s opinion.let us first know from the pros side of the article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; yes, I agree that most of the qualified people from developing countries move to developed or rich countries for better position, work and money. As India is one the developing country I found that most of the Indians move to other countries in search of job and money. According to my opinion an individual should definitely to move to others countries not just for job or money but to learn the technology used by forgein countries learn and inherit or imbibe those and implement in his own country where they can provide empolyment to other individuals. As an individual it shows one`s commitment and hardship towards his country.It also shows one`s enterprenuer skills. I think this brain drain can make poorer countries rich if an individual mind set is to develop his own country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Equally I disagree that this brain drain as a great impact on each an every person as it makes richer countries richer and poor countries poorer because as an individual when we move to other countries to improve or learn or imbibe new things and technology from other countries. But once we move to forgein country people or individual`s turn to adapt the forgein culture and may be the mind set get changed when it comes to money as forgein countries tend to provide good amount of money to that individual for their work when compared to developing countries.In this way it attract many people to move to forgein countries and earn money live a luxury life without any problems.when an individual move from country like India to forgein country they are giving advantage and chance to other countries to utilise the one`s knowledge, ability to improve things with good thinking and innovation where it is a lose to our own country and those people take advantage and make more money by paying less income to the migrates. I generally found very less people who have good intention to move to forgein country make money and come to one`s own country to develop the adapted technology over there and provide empolyment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I think the brain drain of an individual will have impact on the economy of the country and we will find more number of migrates from own country. If there is more number of migrates we will find imbalace in the country`s population.The measures should &amp;nbsp;be taken in the appropiate time by the government of the country and encourage people to work and earn money from the home country. Recent government has encouraged allot to the government (people) to startup with new small, medium, and large startup in the home country where an individual can earn name, good position, continuous work and affordable payment from time to time. There impact is also seen on the economy of the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Government should allow all &amp;nbsp;those migrates whom should move to forgein countries based on profile and job who works for Multinational companies for only short period of time. It should also be responsible for the one who migrates from the home country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Finally I conclude that the brain drain of individual depends on this own mind set what actually he wanted to do for his own country and it shows impact of an individual to make richers countries richer or poorer countries poorer but one`s talent and mind set should make poorer country richer but not richer country poorer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Asia Promises High Growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; Here the article mainly focuses on the rapid growth of asian countries within next five to seven years when compared to the present economic growth. As Asian countries like India and China I found that there is a great demand for small cars where not only a high class people can afford but also the middle and low class people can use the car. Example Nano car which can be affordable by the middle class people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Recent statistic shows that Ford has anticipated to expand sales of 50% by 2015 and the one third portion is from the small car sales are expected by 2020 from the total sales that is 55% from 48%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;.Currently, the automakers exports 40% of Indian -made engines and 25% of Indian-made cars to 35 countries. It already pumped huge amount to India to build manufacturing facitities. It helps to grow one`s networth of the country and rapid growth in India.Not only Ford as increased its manufacturing facilities but General Motors also revealed plans to build four new plants in china where the production capacity increases ans huge amount of empolyment to unempolyed people and great opportunity is found for development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;By the past years statistics we can observe that china has already into the growth stage because it overtook the U.S biggest auto market in the world by sales volumes and also accounted for a one third of the light vehicles sales in the past five years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However CAAM believes that SUVs will remain the fastest -growing segment in the coming years and commerical vehicles will record a moderate gain in sales.In the coming years there will be huge sales for the small cars and light vehicles as both the governments came forward an added huge amount for manufacturing facilities as well as new plants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 - Auto Industry Outlook for Asia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Asia Promises High Growth &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The Asian countries, especially China and India, are expected to account for 40% of growth in the auto industry over the next five to seven years being the rapidly growing economies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Ford anticipates global sales to expand by 50% to 8 million vehicles by 2015 given the potential growth in Asia, mainly China and India; and rising demand for small cars. The automaker anticipates small cars to account for 55% of the total sales by 2020 compared with 48% presently. One third of the small car sales are expected to come from Asia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In late 2012, Ford announced plans to boost exports of its engine production from India by shipping them for the first time to Europe. Currently, the automaker exports 40% of its Indian-made engines and 25% of its Indian-made cars to 35 countries. The company expects to manufacture 450,000 cars and 600,000 engines in India by 2015. It already pumped in $2 billion to build manufacturing facilities in India. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In April this year, General Motors revealed plans to build four new plants in China in order to boost annual production capacity to 5 million vehicles and triple its exports from Chinese plants by 2015. GM and its joint venture partners in China plan to invest $11 billion in the country by 2016 as part of their major expansion program. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In 2009, China overtook the U.S. as the biggest auto market in the world by sales volumes when the Beijing government introduced a stimulus package, including tax incentives for small cars. China accounted for a third of light vehicle sales growth in the last five years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However, the incentives were scrapped in 2011 and the Beijing government imposed quotas on new car registrations in order to control the traffic congestions. In 2012, sales in China grew 4.3% to 19.3 million units, which is lower than the 8% growth projected by China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) as well as the double-digit growth in 2009 and 2010. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the country are expected to improve if the government renews some of its policy incentives that helped the country overtake the U.S. as the biggest auto market. According to the Chinese government, total vehicle sales in China are expected to rise 7.8% to 20.8 million vehicles in 2013 from 19.3 million last year, led by strong demand for passenger vehicles and economic recovery. The CAAM believes SUVs will remain the fastest-growing segment in the year while commercial vehicles will record a moderate gain in sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
