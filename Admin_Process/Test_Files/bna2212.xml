Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt;Exactly,making people is aware is most important,but more important is to convert awareness into action. SWACH BHARATH as introduced by our Prime Minister&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt;Mr. Narendra Modi . The most important thing is to create awareness among the people of India. This &amp;nbsp;awareness praogramme is done by most of the important people like VIP`s , actors and actresses through advertisements, boards, newspapers,media etc. But still after such a great hardwork most of the people in India are ignoring such things. For example in capital city of India most of the people near Railway stations start spitting and doing all other things which should not be done around such places. Not only in Delhi most of the palces in India are getting spoilt by the people of India itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Recently GHMC has started a new initaiative of giving two dustbins foe each house one dry waste and one for wet waste. &amp;nbsp;After such a great effort done by officials most of the public is do not follow. People are using these dustbins for other things. Since, Government has started such a good moto of cleanliness public should follow, and the government should make people to follow otherwise strict actions should be taken by the Government officials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;After spending a lot of time on creating new things for the wellfare of India most of the people are not realizing&amp;nbsp;that their home country should be kept clean. People in slum areas should educated for cleaniness around themselves. Not only the VIP`s should take the iniative of educating people around but also the highly educated people should go in and around India and take up the iniative to educate people around India,most probably in slums. New rules and regulations should be taken up by the government officials about cleanliness. People who do not follow the rules should be strictly punished. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; According to me the Government of India should start a new decision of including atleast one chapter which is more in detail about cleanliness from the starting point of their education. As small children start taking up an initiative of maintaining cleanliness around themselves , this change in children will have a great impact on the people around them.&amp;nbsp;People living near railway stations, public places, religious places etc should take an initiative of keeping trheir surrounding places neat and clean as most of foreigners visit these places.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Government of India should make such a plan that the people who visit India should stay back in India and start up new things more for the wellfare of India, like giving diierent &amp;nbsp;projects to companies&lt;/span&gt;already existing or build up new organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Thank You&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
