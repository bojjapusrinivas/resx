Discuss the impact of technology on education media such as books and magazines. In future, will the tablets replace libraries?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Happy for imporoving our technology in education, in these days every one showing intrest in technology.in my opinion technology will not impact much on education media. we have famous quote on book.. "One Good book is equal to A Good friend", we cannot replace our friend, like that every book has its own value.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Not only in education &amp;nbsp;media, technology showing its impact in every aspect of human life its great &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;with the help of the tablets we can read news papers, magazies,books,every where and easy to carry, and you can access any kind of information from any where,but concentrating more on tablets it may leads to radition and sight problems.But remember Good technology only leads a good development of society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;in future technology may replaces libraries with tablets, here we need a good technology,that will not affect the human beings,and that will not going to harm the society. and most of the rural areas in india dnt aware of technology, how can they access the information, and educated people only can operate the tablets, technology is must ease these problems and come out with a new stratregy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
