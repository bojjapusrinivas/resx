Discuss with examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Modern inventions have made our lives more complex and dangerous&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In our daily live we come across many&amp;nbsp;modern inventions such as&amp;nbsp;computers, walk-mans, I-pod&amp;#39;s,&amp;nbsp;Mobiles&amp;nbsp;and Etc.,&amp;nbsp;As of now, we are facing problems&amp;nbsp;with this modern inventions , such as people as becoming lazy, they want&amp;nbsp;every thing at their place.&amp;nbsp;In this modern&amp;nbsp;era we&amp;nbsp;tend to have&amp;nbsp;every thing ready-made,&amp;nbsp;where we need not to keep any kind of efforts to obtain that. As talking about the computers, it is one of the best invention which we have and at the same time its creates the problems. As kids and young generation age group people as made&amp;nbsp;use this computers for unnecessary things such as chatting , visiting social networking sites and some times they visit un-useful sites where even teen age group are not tend to allow. we find&amp;nbsp;people busy always with computers&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;or laptops and they don&amp;#39;t respond to others when some one call&amp;#39;s them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There is not only the negative impact over the society but also we have some positive side&amp;nbsp;of this modern invention in this digital age. The best example for this , I can present as our ATM deposits machine, before this we tend to visit bank and stand in a queue and deposit the money but due this modern invention it became easy for the common public to deposit there money at&amp;nbsp;in there account just by the ATM machine&amp;nbsp;by which they are able to&amp;nbsp;save there valuable time. And speaking about the computers we find that its gallery of knowledge, by surfing to the sites we can get some precious information and at&amp;nbsp;the same time we can&amp;nbsp;make purchases, sales and can book flight, Train tickets. In some certain cases modern inventions have made our lives simpler.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At the last I just want to conclude that modern inventions in this digital age are much useful and also harmful if we make miss-use of it. Its our primary responsibility to teach the society about the benefits and the drawbacks of this modern inventions. so that the people comes to know what are DO&amp;#39;S and DONT&amp;#39;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
