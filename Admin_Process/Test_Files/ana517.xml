Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; All the sectors in a country are equally important for the development of a nation.But a country&amp;#39;s economic development is purely based on the power&amp;nbsp; and physical infrastructure it possess. A large number of&amp;nbsp;foreign&amp;nbsp; foreign investors like the FDI&amp;#39;s or the FII&amp;#39;s invest in any nation looking at the power producing capability of the country.Based on WEF i.e World Economic Forum&amp;#39;s report India stands in 76th position in terms of power and 98th position&amp;nbsp;in physical infrastructure, out of 118 countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The economic conditions of a country depends upon the GDP, therefore inorder to improve this production capabilities and huge industries are prominent which would support&amp;nbsp;and boost the economy. Apart from the domestic industries&amp;nbsp;most of the&amp;nbsp;countries de-regulate&amp;nbsp;their barriers to a certain extent&amp;nbsp;to attract foreign investors.For example the introduction of LPG i.e Liberalization Privatization and Globalization in 1990&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp; has opened the doors for foreign power&amp;nbsp;producing companies to enter into India and start their operations.The main attracting factor for any foreign investor in any sector,&amp;nbsp;to enter into a country like India is the purchasing power of the population, but inorder to run their production operations power is a major concern, parallely the transport infrastructure (physical infrastructure) is also&amp;nbsp;important to make their products reach the consumer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Therefore in a country like India where it has got a huge power crunch and a very low physical infrastructural facilities, economic development will not be rapid unless these areas are improved. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
