<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:32:44 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between the healthcare supply and demand.As still India is a developing country all the people in the country are not educated. In my view governments are providing the schemes for better healthcare of the citizens of the country but as all the people in the country are not educated so &lt;strong&gt;awarness&lt;/strong&gt; in the people&amp;nbsp;about the schemes provided by the government may not be there.Because of the lack of awarness the gap will be formed. Government need to arrange the &lt;strong&gt;awarness campaigns&lt;/strong&gt; in different areas of the country so that the people will come to know about the different schemes provided by the government.Hence in my view awarness campaigns is one of the major step to be taken by the government.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The next major issue will be with the &lt;strong&gt;cost&lt;/strong&gt;. We can see in private hospitals the cost of the treatment is very expensive which cannot be affordable by a middle class person or a poor person.But the attack of the diseases can not be ristricted only to the rich people who can afford for the private hospitals for better treatment.The &lt;strong&gt;technology, advanced instruments&lt;/strong&gt; used in the private hospitals &amp;nbsp;are more when compared with government hospitals. Private hospitals update themseleves in technology wise very often which has to be implemented by the government hospitals so that there will be flexibility of cost for the people.In my view if government is unable to provide the sevices at government hospitals with advanced technology and instruments which are availble at private hospitals&amp;nbsp;then they should be ready to compensate the people which they need to pay at other hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The government give the &lt;strong&gt;licenses for the private clinics&lt;/strong&gt;. Before giving the licenses to the private clinics government should undergo a&amp;nbsp;kneen observation regarding&amp;nbsp;different issues which are as follows:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; a. &lt;strong&gt;Qualification&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the head of the clinic and staff of the clinic.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;b. &lt;strong&gt;Experience&lt;/strong&gt; of the people working in the clinic.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;c. &lt;strong&gt;Quality of drugs&lt;/strong&gt; used in the clinic.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;d. &lt;strong&gt;Hygenic conditions&lt;/strong&gt; of the clinic.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; e.&amp;nbsp;What&amp;nbsp;are the &lt;strong&gt;different&amp;nbsp;functions&lt;/strong&gt; under taken by the clinic like wheather is it a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; diagnostic&amp;nbsp;center or surgerical etc;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In my view government need to look on to all of these issues before giving the license to the clinics. Because the people in and around&amp;nbsp;a particular clinic will prefer to go to that clinic so it the major responsibility of the government to provide a safe guarded and secure clinics and hospitals to the citizens of the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of the drugs&lt;/strong&gt; is very important. Government should look&amp;nbsp;at that quality drugs should be supplied in the market. And try to find out&amp;nbsp;the duplicate medicines available in the market&amp;nbsp;and bane the companies which are providing them.Special labels should be printed by the government which can not be replaced by the froad companies.Unhyginic or duplicate medicines will cause threat to the lifes of the people so this care should be taken by the government.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment and services&lt;/strong&gt; provided to the patients should be &lt;strong&gt;at quick rate&lt;/strong&gt;. The time taken to attend emergency cases should be done quickly. Because taking longer time for attending a patient may lead to the lost of his/her life.Many of the patiences may be very nervous about treatment, surgeries etc so doctors should be able to counsel and guide them so&amp;nbsp;that the patient can be mentally strong.As many of the patiences who are suffering with dangerous diseases they may be very dipreased so government should try to provide the &lt;strong&gt;counselling centers&lt;/strong&gt; so that the patiences can de mentally strong which is very important for any human being to fight against any thing and doctors also play a very important role in counselling.&amp;nbsp;Hence &lt;strong&gt;committed and responsible doctors&lt;/strong&gt; are very important.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In my view these are the major&amp;nbsp;steps&amp;nbsp; that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
