<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;2/21/2014 10:40:04 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think that even with a population of over 1.2 billion, India has still not be able to produce entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First of all thank you for giving this oppertunity for me to share my views and opinions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;y&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;es, it is good topic curently this happening in our country,there is no particular thing we stick for that ,there is planty of these things india have to over come from those, In india we have 1.2billion population, in this &amp;nbsp;we have lot of divisions or differece in people like religion ,cast system and languages too. &amp;nbsp;politics also playing in it, if anybody want to start a new thing there alot of abstcules &amp;nbsp;like bribes etc. First they have to pay &amp;nbsp;to field officers then politicians. If anybody not agree with this they will not go longer in future but we too like that entrepreneurs like Ambani, Adithya birla ,Vijay moulya etc. but today what is there posion in the world wide compare to others countrie&amp;#39;s entrepreneurs..?, so, we are seprating people by the religion ,caste and language and we have many reasons for it ,even politians also doing that they want they own company have give bids for government works like condtructing dams like metro rail and jala yagnam(in andhra pradhesh) etc. so , this also considered as a reason for this,and one this is fixed in indian blood , that is we have to work for others development not for ours and it is fixed by the politiacans and britishers and our yelders too, suppose any englishmen want to start a bussiness they follow they own ideas and others to give suggetions to him and it will help full for him or her but india it can&amp;#39;t workout like that by the &amp;nbsp; above reason if we follow how they do we will get planty of entrepreneurs like them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; swami vivekanandha told about our country have planty of resoures but we want some persons who is having that maintence capacity leaders, and government too realize by &amp;nbsp;this and giving policy to the new ones so, they is chance for them to grow up in compitative world. There is no use of population of india is but we want only the good guidence for these people then only our freedom fighters dreams will be full filled, they brought freedom from the britishers long ago but we are still in developing stage not developed stage so, it is the right time for our country to be developed and placed in the world map as a super power , First thing we sholud do is we can, we do ,we are united together &amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;so , it is fixed in the mind forever then india will be in better poision then current one, we are master brains who invented the 0(zero) it give to the world in olden days ,we are united at the time of freedom fighting but not now so, it is the time to think ans realize from priviouse mistakes so we can do that again by the voting weapon because it will change and give good politians to our country and our country will be ruled in a right way and yougstars will work hard and there is no jobless and entrepreneurs etc. in my opinion( not mandatry to follow) first we should change our&amp;#39;s mind set then only certain chages will be happen to our motherland think in a bright way and positve then you will work more happly in your life and allow others to follow it. we have millions of yougstars they are ready to do hard work for they own and country too. so our job is to &amp;nbsp;encouage them , we software developers for world and we can bulid our military arms and missiles ( Bramose, Agni) and aircrafts (tejas) but we are also depending others coutries technologies . we hjave develop the people in these many ares in our own knowledge then only our country will be full filled with GDP and developing rate will higher position. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;we have knowledge in books not in hands so we have to prove, it to the world we will reform unity once agian and as a super power country , the above i mention small number of things but we have lot of things to discuss , till now we dont have any universties for students like what western and other countries so, calculate posion in education what our motherland having in world wide the serveys says that in top 400 universties india having 4 universities only that too in above 300 only so ,first from the last.so, we are in a position to not giving good quality of education to our students so, this is the thing all the students are going abroad for higher studies so, there is no knowledge in our education system compare to world class education...? yes, we dont have, because it will lot of money for this so governments are not yet ready to pay this sectors it also considered as a reason for the people why they are not thing as there own feet yet. the regervation system also playing the main role not only in government sectors but also in education system too in scholerships and seats, it is playing major role . how it is means suppose if the person with SC &amp;amp; ST are just qualified an IIT exam and the other caste people are toppers for that IIT exam so, the government system will alLow the SC &amp;amp; ST people only in the top university so there is no chance for the people who qualified as toppers so, we will get good,yound dynamic &amp;amp; unversity students but not in knowledge. this the thing people are thing we dont have any oppertunity in india so , we go abroad for study &amp;amp; sattlement too.am not opposite to the caste system and policies but it is mandatory upto certain areas only not in studies like the above what i mention. if these drastic changes occure in our country then only our counrty will be in developed stage otherwise we are like this.i hope so it will change but it will take time not 5o years like that in few many years only. then our country will get good number of entreprenerus with healthy compitation among them too.most of thinks we will learn from other coutries but we dont follow our&amp;#39;s own it main draw back of our indians right now we have to just start following our moral values and ethicsit will be helpful for us. so, thank you once again giving this oppertunity for me to share my opnions on this topic.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
