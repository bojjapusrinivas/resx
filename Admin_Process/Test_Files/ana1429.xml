<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;5/29/2014 4:09:27 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is India&amp;#39;s expenditure on hi-tech areas justified from the social and economic point of view. Elaborate giving reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India&amp;#39;s expenditure on hi-tech areas justified more in social point of view than economic point of view. india being developing country should concentrate more on developing it rather than spending much on hi-tech areas.todays scenario in India is rich are developing drastically and are improving their standard of living day by day but poor are always left poor,the literacy rate in India is still not up to the mark inspite of providing free education in government schools,one can find child labour in factories,industries and even they are seen at homes for household work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing hi-tech areas does show the country elegant but other aspects also should be well taken care of,developing hi-tech areas is a prestige issue as well it shows the country has good areas with many facilities &amp;nbsp;which leaves a good impression in the eyes of our tourists and neighbouring countries as well,but at the same on other side of coin one can see the poverty of our country which gives a bad impression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one could invest the half of amount spent on these areas on poor and their well being India will be developed nation soon,the current scenario in india is more of significance is given to hi-tech society,they are notable things which we have adopted from the western countries which is a good sign but at the same time the nation should make sure that even poor should be able to utilize them. if one could notice pizza is delivered at door step faster than abulance,this shows how we have changed our country.it is remarkably intresting point the we have developed in many aspects but still we are not called a developed nation because of literacy rate,low economy etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India being a nation where the rich has developed their assets,they live in hi-tech areas where they are provided with all the facilities which the poor cannot even dreeam of,to cite this statement with an example Ambanis house is multistoried building on which crores of money was spent and it has all the provisions and facilities,half of them are &amp;nbsp;not even aware and also not in reach of common man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;To maintain a high social class society the investments on these hi-tech areas is fairly justified.hi-tech areas always been remarkbaly citing an example to quote the richness of the country,india spending on this factor shows we are not left behind anything yet we are left behind because the areas which ought to be developed are still left in the same way,the slums are still found with no proper facilities which are never talked about when we actualy talk about the richness and elegnace of country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;These areas have always been luxiours and convient,these areas have made the forign expats impressive.to talk about more positive aspects these elegance and richness makes forign countries to deal a business with us and also consider our projects, example IT industry which was lacked growth few years back but sooner it is in boom the area surrounding it has become rich which made the employees and forign expats work with pleasure and productrively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;one can now find forign franchises everywhere example mac d,pizza hut,kfc etc which was only possible because of these hi-tech areas or to put in other way after the arrival of these franchies the areas turned hi-tech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;hence i would like to concluding saying country with hi-tech areas makes it elegant and rich but at the same time it should not neglect poor and it should be a helping hnad in striving towards success&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
