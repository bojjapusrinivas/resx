<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/28/2014 4:19:33 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering the present state of Indian economy, outline five key agendas for the newly formed Central Government.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The present state of Indian economy is not well and the new government which was formed on Mr. Narendra Modi, has to follow new agendas and implement them ASAP to raise the Indian economy. The First step which I would suggest is to decrease the Dollar&amp;nbsp;($) price in terms of INR, which was seen when Mr. Modi won the elections that day itself the Dollar ($) price came down which is a good sign. But it should come down more, so that the value of the Rupee will be safe and respectable. Second one is to have a friendly relation with all the SAARC countries, so that they can help us at any point of time. Central Government should strictly keep the SAARC countries relationship. Why I said SAARC is, the countries which are around our country and very easy to access, in other words I can say the neighbors of India. So, our newly appointed PM should keep a good relation with all these neighboring countries. Third point is to bring back the black money which is stuck in the SWISS accounts. We don&amp;#39;t have any idea who all have accounts in that bank. But most of them are political leaders, business mans and higher officers of the central government. So, our newly formed central government should take initiative to get back the amount to India. Coz I read in an article that if we get that black money to India and use to properly and genuinely to the country&amp;#39;s development, no one can pay their taxes for few years and our government need not to stretch hands for help&amp;nbsp;(talking about finance) all the poor people will become middle class, there wont be a poor family in India and the money can be used for building nice/ quality roads/ highways and develop the villages to cities and free studies will be provided to all children. These are the major issues covered if the government get back the amount. AS, I read in the news paper today, Mr. PM appointed a committee to work on this issue and get back the amount soon. I can say this is a phenomenal step towards the financial growth&amp;nbsp;to India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;And the next agenda is to collect the taxes from the people who all are not paying properly and not in time. Most of the business people not paying the taxes according to the rule. But most of the people never get in to this and react to make them pay accurately. so, the new government has to take necessary steps to get the amount. Coz if each and every citizen pay their taxes according to their income the amount will be reused to the country only. But even middle class people also doing the same thing by not paying proper taxes. As per an article in the news paper the amount of taxes if every one pays according to their income, we can build a healthy nation and the country will be prosper in all ways. To eradicate that, the government should take necessary action on the employees who takes bribe for helping these kind of people. This is the great loop to most of the high level people wont pay their taxes according to the income. They bribe the officer and make them to show their income less/ in loss, by doing that government is loosing so much of money interms of tax payments. So, I insist to take care on both the ends i.e.., they should keep a check on the government employee and the tax payees to get the amount to the government. So, I insist this is also a major tumbling block for the Indian economy. Corruption is one of the worst thing happening in India when compared to other countries. Most of the neighboring countries talk about our corruption.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The next point is to get good relation with the countries where we are getting projects from. If we get more project here most of the companies will try to invest more amount here for their growth and as well country growth. Government should attract the investors to invest the amount in India, it will help our nation interms of economical growth and eradicating un-employment as well. Coz if they invest here and build companies, our people will get jobs in the respective companies according to their qualifications and strength. So, this is really helpful for us in either ways. The more investments done in India, the more economy will grow and the un-employment will be reduced. There is one useful thing in this, if people get jobs, they should pay taxes to the government and they are wealthy to pay. So, the government should think and act on this too. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The next point is, now all the central minister and the state ministers have many facilities provided by the government like, they can travel all over India in the flight for free and in train as well. This shows&amp;nbsp;a big impact on the economy of the respective departments. Coz they travel with their families as many times as they can without paying anything. This will be taken care by the government, but the amount they spent on each person is from the government money that is our money. This is a big miss use of money to the people who can afford to pay their travel expenses, and the salaries are also high and they have free stay and food. So, considering all these government should cut the free facilities to the MPs &amp;amp; MLAs, so that they can use the amount for any other good cause. I think if they stop some free facilities to these people,&amp;nbsp;government can make some amount from them&amp;nbsp;which can be used for the country and which&amp;nbsp;is a good sign of development interms of economy and the growth of the county.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;These are the points I would like to suggest to take care of the Indian economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
