<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3/10/2016 10:43:14 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To inculcate the spirit on entrepreneurship in India, the Government launched &amp;lsquo;Start-up India&amp;rsquo; initiative in January 2016. Do you think this initiative would be a historic moment in ushering the era of economic prosperity in India. Please elaborate with reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"Start-up India" is the greatest innovation started by our Indian government. It is started by our Prime Minister Naredra Modi in the month of January, 2016.It is the greatest challenge for the India to sustain in the market and greatest opportunity to the Indians to develop india by many initiatives.It is a platform where many &lt;span class="italic"&gt;Indians have an opportunity to bring many innovations.This startup would definitely help the people who are in a really need of creating business every where.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="italic"&gt; Government of India started many clubs such as E-Hub, and E-cells, such in an order to develope the entrepreneurship skills among the people.This E-Hub or entrepreneur clubs would help people alot it provide an opportunity to the innovators.simple thing is the idea which is generated by the initiators should be new one and a successful business plan should be drafted in order to explain the people.There is also a portal called NEN i.e., National Entrepreneurship Network that creates a network among the entrepreneurs among the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have to be part of any of the clubs and should be a active member and give your best contribution. This clubs will be providing everything such as equipment and necessary stuff to start the business and it guide the people to do things go on.Just what we have to do is to come up with an excellent idea and a succesful business plan.This is a chance given by the government of india so that the new ideas can be generated and many unknown things can be come into existence.The biggest thing is that if you are with a new idea we can create employment to many other people. No need of thinking of financial investment. They provide financial assistance to the people who are with the good plan.so that the Initial investment will be contributed by the government.Profits should be shown to the government during the survival of business.so that many more investments can be contributed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This start up India has brought drastic improvement in the people.people are very busy in new idea generation.This will become an historic movement in the Indian History.By this process the economy of India will also be changing drastly and bring bright future to the people of india.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large; color: #008000;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elevators are those which carry people from one floor to another floor in a same building.Previously this elevators are just used for the same purpose. now the trend have been changed. Due to the development of the people take place everything become changed.Previously there used to be a building of 4-5 floors.Days have been changed.Now a days due to increase and rise &amp;nbsp;in the population this came in to usage drastly.There exists a lot of demand for the elevators globally, due to the technological Improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries such as USA, France, and even though India some part &amp;nbsp;who are having a building contains of 30-40 and more storages. so they are highly depending &amp;nbsp;up on elevators.Chineese Contribution alone in the elevators market is around 53%.They are in a position of expanding their business activities and expected to increase their revenue by 2020.As the chinesse population &amp;nbsp;is high and their contribution to the elevators economy is also high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are companies around globe such as ThyssenKrupp, which is a position to handle 1.1 million elevators. and more over in 2014 it completed great installations. Company Schindler Elevator Corporation had successfuly done the installation of elevator technology in the american union plaza office building.This company got an great opportunity to install &amp;nbsp;the elevator setup in the Hearst Tower and Bank of America and the Humana headquarters in Louisville and , Crescent in Dallas,and many other buildings which are very familiar.It has proved its technology and maintaining its standards and providing &amp;nbsp;excellent service quality and being in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;A part of installing their elevator setup the companies are focusing on parameters such as speed, comforts, and transport system.They frame their elevators which are eco-friendly and reach world wide green standards, in order to provide environmental awareness to people.They also providing different types of elevators for different types of industries. The companies are focusing on the type of industry they are suppling their elevators. For example if they provide for Hospital Industry they should provide with large space and such that basic first aid thinkgs can be placed in the elevator.Customer oriented framing is their main strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the changes in the technology they also providing facilities like communication and access control and various different traits which can satisfy the customer the best by using the best technology.smart elevators are focusing on users and providing excellent features like hygine, space and control and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a lot of change of percentage who are living in cities now compared to 1960s. And there is a expetectany of growth of 1.8% of people year by year.There is a chance for the high development for elevators industry and having a chance of getting high priced projects that are demanding for high quality elevators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the development of the population everywhere year by year, the use of the elevators also have been more in to existence.There is a lot of market for the competetors who are competing in this industry.The main thing for being the market leader in this elevator industry is to understand the requirements of the consumer and draft according to the requirement of the consumer and according to the industry and do the best, will leads to the development of the business in this elevator industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also usage of elevators in offices, hotels and lodgings, and health care industries and the manufactures also keep in mind things such as customer capacity and time taken to transport people and safety of the people, and spacious in the field of healthcare.The elevators should also been manufactured which are very less energy consuming and with more speed.Customer should satisfied when he uses the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usage of smart elevators will be helpful in the public places so that it can save power and serves the best.There is also a commercial application in the elevator market i.e.,when theere is a usage of elevators in the public places there is a huge amount of flow of people using elevators, and the manufacture should frame according so that in a trip it should carry maximum number of people and with atmost comfort, with efficient electricity saving such as consuming less power when ever there is less flow of people and consuming more power when there is a more flow of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government also should provide &amp;nbsp;star rating facility at the time of quality check and assure the buyers for the best purchase and the maximum usage.So that the companies will be manufacturing the elevators with most quality and reliability, that can able to save more efficiency of power and maintain the sustainability for a long period of time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So according to my opinion the companies should prepare elevators according to the consumer perspective by following the atmost quality functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
