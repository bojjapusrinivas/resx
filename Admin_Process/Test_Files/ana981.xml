What do you think are the major steps that can be taken in present circumstances to push growth in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inflation is one the major problem that india is facing during these days.As the doller rate is increasing the rupee value is going down .But when compared with other countries economy, India is far better and effect is less and India is able to withstand the inflation effect.Because&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of rules framed byRBI there is no much effect on Indian economy.But we can see the people who are of average and above average classes are facing the inflation so much. Even though the government is taking so many measures to control ,but still the effect can be seen.Inorder to push the economy&amp;nbsp;forward we should encourage foreing investors to invest in the country and as recently government is encouraging foreign invetors to invest in&amp;nbsp; building railways which is one of major project of the government.The exports of the country &amp;nbsp;should be encouraged and the imports from foreign countries&amp;nbsp;should be reduced inorder to earn foerign exchange as imports increase th foreign currency of the country will be reduced&amp;nbsp;.Because of the huge population india is unable to curb inflation efficiently.The economic position of the people&amp;nbsp;also plays a major role.RBI should &amp;nbsp;take frame rules in such a way that Indian economy should withstand the inflation . As we can see china and other countries also adopted globlisation at the same time when India did, but the measures taken by&amp;nbsp;RBI helped india to withstand the inflation and the effect&amp;nbsp;of inflation is much &amp;nbsp;less&amp;nbsp;when compared with those countries.&amp;nbsp;The norms and rules should be framed in an efficient way and they should be implemented strictly inorder to withstand and face the inflation in efficient manner.Foreing institutional investors should be encouraged to invest in our country.By following the RBI rules in a correct way the Indian economy can grow and face the inflation in better way with no much effect on economy and even on the people of the country.&lt;/font&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
