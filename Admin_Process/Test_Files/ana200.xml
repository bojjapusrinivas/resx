What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India is a free country,An independent nation,A democratic body.People living in India are considered to be holding power to choose as it is said that Government in India is by the people,for the people,of the people.Geographically,India may not be the world largest land holding nation but it is the largest diversity of multi-lingual, multi-religion people,It has a space for a rickshaw hawker and an American doctor holding phd degree.India is considered to be the growing country,there was a time when farmers themselves worked on their fields and now they have got big automated machines ploughing and watering their lands,A country which has seen the journey from being slaves to an outside country to a country of complete independence. Independence is a word that is usually related to the date &amp;quot;August 14,1947&amp;quot; A small child to an old lady,everybody wold say we got Independence on this day from englishmen but are we free from Poverty, Caste Descriminaton. A study says that the largest part of the luxury in our country is cherished by the smallest part of ultra rich people and the largest part that is our brothers living below the poverty line do not get their two meals a day.It seems just the urban areas and big cities are a part of our country&amp;#39;s map and the rural area is just exposed to some english director for making an oscar winning movie.A person in chair with air conditioners on would never realize the feet of the burning feet of a child walking kilometers to get a bucket full of water then why do we pledge every morning &amp;quot;All Insians are my brothers and sisters&amp;quot; we should revise it to &amp;quot;only urban Indians&amp;quot;.Sometimes it seems there are only one way roads connected between rural and urban areas because nobody wants to go back there.India has a heavy percentage of people who are living everyday with inadequate supply of essential resources that are needed for a man to survive.In recent newspapaer aticle,malnutrition in children came up as a concern for the country,and it was mainly found in rural area&amp;#39;s children because nursing mothers do not get proper nutritional diet resulting in health disorders in mothers as well as their progeny.How shall we name it as a &amp;quot;DEVELOPED INDEPENDENT DEMOCRATIC&amp;quot; country when half of my mother land is mal-nutritioned,uneducated,unemployed,deprived of essential commodites.The truth is today also there exists areas where women are burnt because they couldn&amp;#39;t give birth to a male zygote,areas where education to girls is socially unacceptable,where child marriage is celebrated with great pomp and show,where people wait for weeks for a water tank&amp;nbsp;in their village,where fathers promise food and end up making them sleep empty stomachs,and yes they exist in India but city people are too idle to know that.Here a&amp;nbsp;city girl would not wear a dress once worn and&amp;nbsp;there, a village girl would wait for her birthday to get an old dress.Descrimination doesn&amp;#39;t end up when I stop differentiation between black and white,it will end up when the people in power would see the whole nation as one not divded into rich and poor.Disparities do not end overnight,Change does not come with a single person changing,Its not easy but it is possible.The biggest difference is the difference of mind set,People in rural areas have a mind set seeded of hundred years and is continuing.Education is one tool that can help,Awareness in another.People living that area shall be made aware,there are advertisements starring A-star who emphasise on education&amp;nbsp;but do all people in rural araes have access to these media,certainly not. It is important to spread the word.Once they are educated,they will know their rights,their duties and it will make a change.Women empowerment is one the major issues faced in our&amp;nbsp;country,Woman has to know her rights,Once she starts respecting herself,Nobody would disrespect her.Some people think a school with digital boards and englisg speaking teachers with air conditioned rooms can only help in learning,Its just a myth.A Teacher,a pen,a paper,a shad tree would serve the purpose.Government shall take care of the water,electricity,work and food supply to these areas.Many programs like &lt;em&gt;Pradhanmantri Grahmin Yojana, Grahmin rozgaar yojna,navjoti sngathan, navjat shishu yojana&lt;/em&gt;,etc are running in different part of country,Its not like nothing is happening for the change,steps are being taken,rules are laid,they are just needed to be put on the top of priority list so that the rate of change multiplies and poverty rate divides.Many campaigns are organized,polio camps are set up,At the time of British rule,Mahatma Gandhi,Bhagat Singh and many more were planning to get freedom but it took time to actually witness it,A seed sown takes more than ten years to completely grow and become a fruitful tree,The seed is sown,the tree will be grow,we just need to keep watering it and see it gets the proper sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;India will become a developed nation,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;once every individual sleeps with a filled stomach&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; we just need to do&amp;nbsp;well&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;preparation,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;And Let our children&amp;nbsp;cherish&amp;nbsp;the result&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
