<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:38:18 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;font size="3"&gt;India is a developing country with huge population. It has different states with different customs and culture. Now India is progressing &amp;nbsp;to reach with the developed countries by making vast improvement in its technology and expanding its business globally and thus improving its economy. In this process due to lot of urbanisation and industrialisation there is lot of global warming and pollution which effected huge population.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;font size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In most of the population is illiterate and ignorant of hygine. Most of them do not have healthy life style . Especially the rural people are ignorant about the health and hygiene. They do not have the knowledge of healthy food habits. Most of the workers &amp;nbsp;who are not educated working in factories, industries and in big project aresas do not take enough of precautions and care and they neglect their health and suffer with diseases for example workers working in chemical,metellergical especially oilrefinaries and railways and metro works . Though the company offers medical facilities still the problem persists as different kinds of new diseases are cropping up. There is huge demand for pharmaceauticals industries but the supply of medicines is less because lot of research has to be done for this the government has to have team for reaearch and sufficicient funds and equipments,lab facilities and infrastructure has to be established. Though there are many research labs and pharmaceautical companies are there but compared to the alarming diseases and health conditions these are not sufficient to meet the requirement. Even th e employees at different levels are suffering with diseases due to stress and pressure of work but they are not being getting proper medical facility . The major steps our government can take to improve patient &amp;nbsp;is first by educating people about well nutritious balanced diet. secondly the hospitals be well maintainted with simplified rules and regulations so the patient willget immediate care without any delays and negligences on their part . Thirdly the doctors should be mere polite and make the patient aware of the disease and how he can help himself to cope after treatment by taking medicines and diet .The nurses should be well trained to take immence care to the patient as most of the time the patient is taken care by the nurse.,the nutritionists should take enough of responsibility to let the patient know about the importance of nutritious food and its role in bring thje patient to normal condition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;font size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lastly i would like to conclude that government should come up with many hospitals to care of poor and down trodden people who economically backward and supply them with medicines freely and encourage medical department to sent a team separately assigned only to develop the awareness about the health and its importance. Many rural areas do not have proper medical shops with required medicines so it should strive for opening of many dispensaries with ample supply of medicine &amp;nbsp;and develop for hail and healthy India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
