What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People living in big cities most definitely enjoy several benefits which are not available for people living in rural areas &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;most of them are&amp;nbsp;living a life in obscurity &amp;amp; are completely oblivious to the contemporary ways of the&amp;nbsp;world living in&amp;nbsp; Big cities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Be it in terms of the job oppurunities ( of your domain), Good salary package, realisation of dreams, a luxurious life, all of these&amp;nbsp; are only to be found in&amp;nbsp;Big Cities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The job oppurtunities&amp;nbsp; that we find in cities &amp;amp; the&amp;nbsp;freedom to express oneself&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in one&amp;#39;s specific area of interest &amp;amp; pursue the job of your dreams can only come true in cities. To put plan to action . there can be no other place than the cities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;To minimize the disparity between them, i firmly believe that the government needs to play a strong role. It needs to provide the infrastructure that will help the people residing in rural areas experience a life that is currently being experienced by the people living in cities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;By building Colleges, employing teachers that have tremendous connaissance of the subject thats they are teaching rather than just being show-pieces &amp;amp; just doing the job for the very sake of it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Also by providing wholesome education &amp;amp; skill development , so that the students studying&amp;nbsp;in rural areas&amp;nbsp;grow holistically.A comprehensive education plan needs to be put into place comprising all those things which the students studying in urban areas get &amp;amp; so that they dont feel isolated when they make the transition from rural to Urban.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We have seen a technology boom in the contemporay world, so the governmet must ensure people in rural areas are not deprived of the technical education &amp;amp; are able to match step-to step with the people living in Urban areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Absence&amp;nbsp;of job oppurtunties, the&amp;nbsp;domain&amp;nbsp;in which a person aspires to be . for instance IT, Media there should be scope for people to apply in such domains.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The people in urban areas are far better equipped to handle pressure situations then those in rural areas&amp;nbsp;simply beacuse of the world-class education that is provied in their respective domains.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Also i believe, It is the duty of those priveleged &amp;amp; residing in&amp;nbsp;urban areas to contribute as much as they can&amp;nbsp;via&amp;nbsp;funding to the government&amp;nbsp;or by any other means to help the rural areas develop better infrastructure &amp;amp; sanitation, which is indispensable for the proper growth of the people in rural areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
