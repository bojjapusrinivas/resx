Please take a stand and discuss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;#39;INDIA&amp;#39; as a country is known for its unity and diversity which includes people belonging from different religions,speaking different languages and different food habits and having different traditional clothes.Be it from the north-east to the west or from the north to the south, one can experience differences.Secondly,as we are also aware about India&amp;#39;s rapidly growing population&amp;nbsp;which seems to be a hurdle in India&amp;#39;s economic growth. Thirdly, as we also know that a large proportion of the population is residing in the slum areas with no housing facilities for the people living below the poverty line and with less employment opportunities for illiterates and due to the competition among the graduates and other highly qualified candidates all over India,population is witnessed as a burning issue for our country and for its citizens.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; However,there is no doubt at all that the goverment and the private sector are giving ample job opportunities in both urban and rural areas. As we accept that Science is a boon and is also a curse for the world, similarly, rapid increase in the population has become a curse for mankind.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In this competitive and dynamic world,every individual and every company is facing challenges in different aspects especially in the job and market sector.Versatile changes can be seen and therefore the gap between success and failure has to be bridged.Knowlege is something which has to be gained,utilized and passed on.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Moreover,due to the increase in population we can see its various affects in our education and service sector.Non-availability of sufficient number of seats in highly graded schools and colleges, delay in promotions for government officers are some of the drawbacks.In addition to that hunger,malnutrition and non.availability of sufficient food for women and children living below poverty line is a matter of great concern.Unemployment and poverty is also leading to commit crimes such as theft,robbery etc by the people belonging to the age group ranging from 20-40 and also by adolescents.Parents with no job in there hands force their children to work in bidi and glass manufacturing factories.Girls without parents are forced by their relatives to go to cities to work as domestic helpers.Another factor which can be seen is the change in migration trends.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Therefore, this is the present scenario which needs to be changed.Birth control programs should be made aware to the rural people and immediate measures&amp;nbsp;should be taken to control population not only in India but also in the whole world.Hence, participation not only by the goverment and the private sector but also by the individual must be made mandatory for the development amd progress of India as a Nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
