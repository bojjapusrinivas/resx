<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:37:45 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health care sector is the most vital&amp;nbsp;sector as it deals with the&amp;nbsp;services realted to life&amp;nbsp;. India is one of the major country that has been facing crisis in health care sector since past.Although there are many health care companies established in the country there is no proper supply of medical services to the people.Specially in the rural areas where most of the people are uneducated and do not even know the proper medication. They simply rely on the doctors and other pharmaceuticals.Hence,it is very essential&amp;nbsp; to develop this sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The highly developed countries like America and Europe are the leaders in health care sector, where it is highly developed with good hospitals,pharmaceutical industries etc.But,In our country there is no&amp;nbsp; proper medication available ,which is evident from the situations we usually see near the government hospitals.Patients are humiliated,degraded by the hospital department, where women were found giving birth to the &amp;nbsp;babies on road itself.There are so many situations like this.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The pharma industry is also not well developed in our country,except few companies like Cipla,Reddys and so on.Recently a&amp;nbsp;fatal&amp;nbsp;incident has occured in Rajasthan,where people were supplied with spurious medicines at low cost, there was an increased mortal rate in the country because of this practices.Even there are many unauthorised pharmacy stores as well.Selling the drugs for a higher rate,where poor people cannot afford.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There is a great demand for the medicines, but the supply is poor.THe government should take proper steps in order to develop the health care sector and render service to people.Although,government has taken the initiative of providing health cards to some people, it should be noticed whether it has reached the person,&amp;nbsp; the people are&amp;nbsp;really satisfied with that or not. I would suggest few actions that should be taken up by the government to improve this sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Encourage the established pharmaceutical sectors in manufacturing effective drugs and new drugs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Appoint pharmacovigilance teams,quality assurance,quality control teams,drug inspectors in&amp;nbsp;all medical areas.That ensures quality in production.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Thorough inspection in hospitals whether it is a public or private sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Arrange health campaigns ,specially in rural areas which helps the people residing there as well as giving&amp;nbsp;an oppurtunity for the young medico&amp;#39;s to render their effective services.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Improving the hospital system, giving priority to health than money.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;People must be educated regarding the medicines and the usage of those,so that there would be less cases of infection and death.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Collaboration with developed countries like Germany, to fetch advanced medications for stubborn diseases.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Establishing more hospitals in rural areas giving importance to patients care.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Enhancing the environment of hospitals,improving the tools and process used in hospitals,&amp;nbsp;in order to render proper service.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Lastly,recognising the best persons(scientists) who had shown great achievement in research,service sector by providing them a way to excel and reach great heights in their career.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If the government takes an oath to implement all these actions, no longer our country&amp;nbsp; would be backward in health care sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
