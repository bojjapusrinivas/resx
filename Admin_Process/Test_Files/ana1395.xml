<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;3/26/2014 10:48:52 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under Indian parliamentary democracy, is it possible to ensure balanced regional development? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India is a democratic country and the people who were in the backward are remaining back and the people who are manipulating the environment are moving fast in terms of growth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Other than India there is no other country having reservations and category wise based preference, this should be overcome with new rules that should state that EQUITY FOR ALL.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Regional development will be successful if there is a balanced religion development. so, Indian parliamentary heroes have to think more in terms of religion development&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;By considering an example o0f sate bifurcation, The cost of lands and assets will be in a harmonic mode and no one can estimate its cost fluctuation. So there will be huge loss for the middle class people who invested their savings in assets.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that there will be a change in regional development. Because, the villages which are at the corner of districts will remain same and the places which are under urban will get developed. Due to this the people are losing their hope in their lives and that&amp;#39;s why there is a high death rate of farmers in India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Balanced regional development comes with balanced politicians. I can strongly say that there is not even a single person who is doing right politics and they are learning how to do politicking with the common people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;For example, every citizen in India knows that Indian government is bringing millions of liquid cash from foreign banks for the development of India and in between the changing of hands it self the weight of amount is getting reduced.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The cause of bringing money is for development and the effect is up on the common man like increment of tax rate, bus charges, electricity charges etc., which effect more on middle class.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We can take our Andhra Pradesh as an example of under development with millions of flowing cash in the hands of politicians. Even our beloved Chief Minister also announced knew party and they are looking for themselves and to fill their pockets.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The person who do good to the public is an leader and there is not even a single leader to expect growth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There is no regional growth but there is a growth in terms of politicking. I can easily say that all the places and districts are not in the same growth level but the same government is ruling all the areas, where is the growth?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;By considering agriculture sector also in to the&amp;nbsp;part, Just think of who is getting benefitted,&amp;nbsp;is he a farmer? no and not at all. Traders and the middle men are getting benefitted and the brokerage costs are increasing and farmers are not getting their&amp;nbsp;hands on price.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;By keeping this in mind our government allowed FDI in to retail sector where the farmer will get his hands on price and initial investment for his crop and production.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If any region want to develop there&amp;nbsp;should be a industries which are related to the area crop and then farmers can directly sell their goods by eliminating the middle men.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This is an perfect example in terms of regional development. i.e.,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There is village in Gujarat and there we can see the municipality office as an corporate office and the Gujarat government is doing well for the village like all the streets are having the electronic&amp;nbsp;devices and if any announcement happens it will be heard for all at the same time and no one can stop their work.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Agricultural training is also given to the farmers regarding the usage of pesticides and giving empowerment to the women and providing them an opportunity to work for their own.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If all the villages, towns, cities follow this kind of strategy and if they implement then definitely India will be developed country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The intention of politicians have to change from growing themselves to serving common people and then India will be a perfect democratic country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Regional development can happen if there is an opportunity and employment to the youth because 70% of the population in India is under the age of 30 to 35. There is no other country in this world having drastic youth population rate like India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;My conclusion is, if there is a leader in terms of saying politician and the person who is in the position using the resources effectively an&amp;nbsp;efficiently and looking for the problems faced by the common man, then definitely regional development will have a scope and automatically employment can get in to a good stage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
