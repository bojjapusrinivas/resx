For an developing country like an india,it must have very clear vision about the future generation. As we consider the aspects in which india need to be upgraded are like Technology, globalisation, IT, Pharma Industry, manufacturing sector, service sector. As of now we are concerned about the population in the country,due to that lot of problems are facing by people and the government. The main problem genarated by the population are like transportation, we have various means of transportation like road, railway, airway, and seaways etc. In transportation, railways is the one which covers almost all 50% transportation needs and sevices by them and is the worlds biggest railways is indian railways&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Though the railways is the biggest transportation in india,it is being used since from 1890`s and the technology used by the indian railways is very outdated and the its covers almost all cornors of the india. the indian railways are lacking in technology and also in providing some good quality services to the travellers. The biggest concern is that railways wont maintain time management in the system.In this corporate society, people are concerned about the time management and the services provided by the railway system. To overcome this problem in the country the technology of the indian railways should be updated, like the highly developed countries in the world which are using like bullet trains or fastest trains. china has the worlds fastest train in their railways system. India need to concered about implementing the high end technology in the indian railways.As far as i concerned some of the metropolitan cities in the country are implementing or planning for the technology advancement in the railways like superfast trains, bullet trains etc. through this india can be forwarded in the technology development and infrastrature development and it can clear the main traffic problrms in the country. Transportation is the biggest now and the future generation problem in the country,by providing the services like bullet trains and fastest trains in the country it could means alot to the developing country like indi&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;a.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;India need to focus also in providing good trains or better trains and quality services because in these vast country, providing world class technology in railways in a short span &amp;nbsp;is high impossible because it need a lot of infrastruture, capital, and time consuming factor.firstly it need to implement by providing better trains and services also and try to implement advanced trains in the metropolitan citites, such that it can very easy for a developing country like india. though it is a time consuming factor but raising huge funds or capital from country is risky and higly impossible. Due to recent demonetisation in the country has hitted the economy badly and almost all it takes one year to recover from that impact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;India need to focus on providing better and good trains along with some quality services to the people and at the same time it need to implement some high end technology in some the developed and highly crowded cities such that it could be able clear some of the current problems facing by the people in the country. Now at these present situation india relevently needs better trains and quality services aslo, as the future is concerned the fast growing development in this vast country technology advancement should be there so it need to be implementing some bullet trains in some metropolitan cities in the country. By this we can coclude that better trains are the present requirement need to be provided and it should have future vision of providing bullet trains where there is a desperate need for that in the future generation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
