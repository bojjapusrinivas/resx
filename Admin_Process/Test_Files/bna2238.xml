Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes,absolutely making people aware is important,but more importance is to convert awareness into action ,without the action the change should not be possible by people.But people should know the importance of clean india.The government of india is giving lot of advertisements in tv`s,newspapers about the clean india, the people are seeing the newspapers and tv`s but no one didnot follow the rules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The government of india is created the awareness about the clean india but they didnot provide &amp;nbsp;how to it convert into action and how to change the people`s mindset,but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;i think with out awareness how to we go to action.clean india means not cleaning by the roads,it means keep the your surroundings neatly and don`t throw the warebottles on the roads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Why the government want to give the awareness about the clean india it is inner thinking of every person,in foreign countrys the government is not giving any awarenes about clean. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
