To what extent do you agree with this statement? Provide reasons for your answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The term Economy possess a diverse meaning, which includes every day activities of human beings, there interaction within themselves and with the physical components of the environment surrounding them. Many economists describe economy in simple terms as utilisation of natural resources tro meet the demands of of community on whole. it generally includes the transactional activities, social welfare programmes, manufacturing processes, distribution of goods and services to meet the demand. Economy of a country depends on the effective production of required goods and services and their distribution. This requires proper planning and utilisation of human force and tangible goods. The elements of and economy range from small scale industries to major manufacturing units. These are the basis for the development of a country. Along with production of materials, proper distribution channels are necessary which are mostly dependent of the imfrastructure of the community or an area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; Economy planning requires analysing the requirements, needs, demands that particular community, accessing the availability of factors of production, then acquiring proper financial muscle and capital investment and others pre-production processes. After the production stage distribution, advertising, marketting are the prime important jobs to b carried out. these include back-end and front-end processes like transporatation, storage facilities, electricity, water facility etc. Infrastructure planning takes the pivotal role to efficiently handle the distribution channel from the producer to the end user. The satisfaction of the consumer gives the end result of whole process. the cyclic flow of goods and services, financial transactions, exports and imports add to the economic growth. For example establishing a cloth factory fulfils the need of outfits and a hospital can ensure the healthy wellbeing of a community in an area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Planning should be intended with a motive for the overall development of the society and earning profits. However the growth of economy of a country should be inclined to sustainable way. It should protect the rights and interests of community. Environment Conservation is the major aspect of any planning body. It take into considearation the effects of economic planning on the environment. natural resources are the biggest gift to the planet Earth. Over-utilisation or mis-utilisation cause damage to the environment, which further effects the production process in later stages. Few resources are replenishable and few are not. It is task of the planning bady to carefully examine the type of resources, their avialability and usage. this is mainly importtant for scare resoures. Also inefficient methods of extraction resources damage the harmony of balanced communities causing pollution which inturn results in health hazards, natural hazards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Rapid use of resources and technology by developed countries to win the race and inefficient methods adopted by developing and under-developed countries due to lack of awareness and technical expertise bas largely effected the planet on whole. This resulted in rise of global warming, hazards, displacement of natural habitat, extinction of various species &amp;nbsp;and other environmental issues. For example nucler hazard of Fukushima Nuclear Plant, Bhopal gas tragedy has taken the lives of many and caused lot of damage to the property and human settlements. Over utilisation might also replenish the resources which have to be passed on to future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Therefore it is neccesary to have a proper Environment Accessment report based on the pros and cons of an economic activity to be undertaken. It should involve the assent of projects with best and eco-friendly processes, effects to underlying communities, compensation etc. The analysed report should be held for the consensus of the related communities so as to gain the dissent over societal issues and their local sentiments. For which the communities need awarness regarding the project. Attached ministries should throughly check the effects of the project on whole economy and then give its approval.As the very basic fact is that the main source of the resources is the nature, thereby protecting the same will sustain the humankind for long.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;File Name:June2013GlobalAutoIndustryOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The global production of automobiles is highly restricted to the hold of major auto-mobile companies like Genral motors Company, Toyota Motors Corp. etc. Based on an analysed report of first five months in 2013 in the U.S market, General Motors Company held the top share of 18.0%, followed by Ford Motor Co. with a share of 16.40%, Toyota Motors Corp. with 14.2% etc. Though Toyota recaptured the top position in 2012 by selling 9.75 million vehciles globally. Thereby confirming that the top positions are always occupied by these listed companies but with tracable fluctuations and swaping in their ranking. These all companies accounted for 80% of worldwide share in auto industry and 90% sales share in total vehicles sold in U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;To earn the competitive hand in the global ever changing market, it has become neccessary for companies to come out with new designs and attractive models with low cost and advanced technology. Strategic approach taken by Ford Company to suit the taste and demands of customers has lauNched multiple models at its various plants witha atrget of 4.5 models by the 2015.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Low cost markets in developing countries and other developed countries have grabbed the interest of automakers. China and South America alone accounted for half the growth of light vehicle production in past seven years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The governtment flexible policies and procedures add to the development of automobile companies. With this approach U.S has dragged the focus of these companies like GM, Ford, BMW etc by adoption of fuel economy standards and light-duty trucks. Hence it is neccesary for all develaoping nations to re-examine there energy efficient policies and government red tape procedures to invite the global market of automobile sector in its domestic sector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 &amp;ndash; Global Auto Industry Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In the first five months of 2013, General Motors Company ( GM ) led with a 18.0% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. ( F ) with a 16.4% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. ( TM ) with a 14.2% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 11.7% market share, and Honda Motor Co. ( HMC ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( NSANY ) at the last spots with 9.5% and 8.1% market shares, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;OPPORTUNITIES &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;To remain competitive, the automakers will need to design vehicles that will cater to consumers in both mature and emerging markets while manufacturing them at low-cost using the most advanced technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;For example, Ford has undertaken "One Manufacturing" strategy, which aims at producing multiple models from plants across the world in order to save production costs and fast adaptation to changes in consumer tastes. The automaker anticipates producing 4.5 models at each of its plants by 2015, up from 3.6 models currently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Further, the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features (which will save money on gas), even on the small and less gas-guzzler vehicles in order to attract buyers. The sale of optional features is helping them offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to large trucks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The automakers continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. According to a study by CSM Worldwide, China and South America together will represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The role of governments is highly significant. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years. In late 2011, 13 major automakers, including Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Volvo, have signed letters of commitment with the U.S. Government to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
