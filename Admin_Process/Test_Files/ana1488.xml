Do you think the Bill can help protect people against poverty and insecurity?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The food security bill is definitely a boon for the Indian Economy. India is one of the largest country in terms of its population and to fulfil the requirements of more than 100&amp;nbsp;million stomachs, such kind of decision is a prerequisite.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Indian economy is&amp;nbsp;an agriculture Based economy.&amp;nbsp;Which is completely dependent on the weather condition. A good monsoon can bring an economic boom and a draught can cause Economic draught. No doubt India is one of the fastest growing developing countries, its population is growing even faster. Its difficult to provide&amp;nbsp;bread and butter of every individual. All the majors taken to eradicate poverty&amp;nbsp;goes in vane or we can say that&amp;nbsp;every action&amp;nbsp;falls short of it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;On one&amp;nbsp;hand India is trying its presence to felt on the world map and on the other hand a big chunk of its population is sleeping without having a single meal in a whole day. Many kids are found malnourished and even expectant mothers are not provided with healthy meal or vitamin supplements. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Poverty is a big challenge for&amp;nbsp;the government. In present scenario It&amp;#39;s the mother of many problems.&amp;nbsp;It leads to&amp;nbsp;lack of education, unemployment, increase in crime rate, poor health and hygiene, child labour&amp;nbsp;and a sense of insecurity among its nation. All these problems are interdependent and the cycle goes on. &amp;nbsp;Thus poverty, not only&amp;nbsp;leads to other problems but&amp;nbsp;in turn&amp;nbsp;it increases further itself. Poor becomes poorer with time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Thus It is very much important to eradicate the root cause of&amp;nbsp;all the problems. In this world of cut throat competition at least every individual deserves&amp;nbsp;proper food, education and&amp;nbsp;sanitation. &amp;nbsp;And this food security&amp;nbsp;bill is just a forward&amp;nbsp;step in this direction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This bill will&amp;nbsp;boost the economy. There will be food for all. People will be less bothered for their meals instead they will channelize their energy in doing some thing better for their nation. Human resources will be exploited for better work. There will be intense sense of security among public.&amp;nbsp;All this in turn will make India shine and dazzle again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;With more of this kind of bill Indian&amp;nbsp;economy will blossom for sure.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
