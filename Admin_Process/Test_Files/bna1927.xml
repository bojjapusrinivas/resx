To what extent do you agree with this statement? Provide reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Yes,Economic and infrastructural planning of an area should be done keeping in mind the environment conservation.I completely agree with the statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Business development,Economic growth,Profits might be the priority for an entity or economy, but safeguarding the environment should be the responsibility of every individual and organizations,because it helps us and the future generations to live happily.If we establish a factory near a river and dump the waste in the river,polluting the river and there by causing a threat to the aquatic animals and the human depending on the river,the habitation in the area gets disturbed.Likewise,emission of enormous amount of smoke from the industries in an area, where there is already high pollution, sometimes lead to Acid rains,which are harmful.We have a live example of the area surrounding Tajmahal.The area has many factories emitting heavy pollution and harmful gases.The Acid rains near the Tajmahal are the result of the pollution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;If an industry is established in a forest area after making deforestration in the area, environmental imbalance occurs between the flora and fauna of the area, thereby leading to the death of many animals due to the lack of food and shelter.Likewise,if an industry is set up in the area which is inhabitated by many people, people face problems because of the wastes and smoke of the industries.Electricity is also a reason.Heavy usage of power leads to shortage of electricity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Therefore,it should be the responsibility of the industries,organisations to follow corporate social responsibility.spending a percent of the profits of the organisation towards corporate social responsiblity(c.s.r.) has become a norm.The organisations which are established after deforestration of an area should take up the responsibility of planting sufficient number of plants, so as to maintain the environmental balance.The wastes should not be unnecessarily thrown into rivers.Steps should be taken to avoid establishing industries near areas where more people are inhabited.Establishing industries near under developed rural areas also helps in the unemployment problem in the area.The organisations should keep in mind certain things like availability of water, location,that is a bit far away from the city,etc.Economic and infrastructural &amp;nbsp;planning of an area should be done keeping in mind the environment conservation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013GlobalAutoIndustryOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated in the sense there is heavy competition in the field among the top global automakers.The percentages indicate their command in the auto industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data relating to first five months of 2013 in the U.S. indicate that there is less scope for new auto makers in the country.The sales figures of 2013 show that there is cut-throat competition between the two automakers Toyota and the General Motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPPORTUNITIES:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stay in the competition, the auto makers should design vehicles that satisfy the needs of both developed and developing markets.Further usage of low cost technology should be the priority.Providing customers with optional features help the company`s growth.The automakers need to find the low-cost regions and shift the production to the areas so as to manufacture with relatively low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The role of governments plays a crucial role.The governments should sign MOU`s with the automakers relating to the manufacture.This helps the productivity and development of the economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 &amp;ndash; Global Auto Industry Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In the first five months of 2013, General Motors Company ( GM ) led with a 18.0% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. ( F ) with a 16.4% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. ( TM ) with a 14.2% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 11.7% market share, and Honda Motor Co. ( HMC ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( NSANY ) at the last spots with 9.5% and 8.1% market shares, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;OPPORTUNITIES &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;To remain competitive, the automakers will need to design vehicles that will cater to consumers in both mature and emerging markets while manufacturing them at low-cost using the most advanced technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;For example, Ford has undertaken "One Manufacturing" strategy, which aims at producing multiple models from plants across the world in order to save production costs and fast adaptation to changes in consumer tastes. The automaker anticipates producing 4.5 models at each of its plants by 2015, up from 3.6 models currently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Further, the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features (which will save money on gas), even on the small and less gas-guzzler vehicles in order to attract buyers. The sale of optional features is helping them offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to large trucks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The automakers continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. According to a study by CSM Worldwide, China and South America together will represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The role of governments is highly significant. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years. In late 2011, 13 major automakers, including Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Volvo, have signed letters of commitment with the U.S. Government to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
