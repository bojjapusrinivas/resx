Please take a stand and discuss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India is not a developed country with high population . here theliteracy ratio is very less, so the gorvernmetn should concentrate on making more people literate rather than concentrate on a small group of population. Students from IITS and IIMS are moving out of India and serving othe nation&amp;#39;s organizations. Which results in the wastage of all the investment made nby government towards educating these students.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;India is a democratic country and democracy can only be successful by achieveing 100% literacy rate which is possible by concentrating primary education. Government should make &amp;nbsp;a conscious effor to make more people literate rather then concentrating their sum on a amall and confined population. Spending huge amount of money on IITS And IIMs is dividiung the nation in two different communities, one community is not even having primary education where as the other community is having higher ecducation which will result in rich becoming richer and poor becoming &amp;nbsp;poorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Students studying in IITS AND IIMS can avialo loans and can easily refund them because of the higher pays they are getting &amp;nbsp;from their jobs. After completion of the degree but that won&amp;#39;t be the case for the poor children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Most of the people going for the IITS or IIMs are self &amp;nbsp;capable. So funds should only be used for those students who are financially backward. IIMS AND IITS re huge organisations and have enough money to cater to their needs and should instead help the Govenment to put the money to the righ use. After all , spreading education is the real motive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
