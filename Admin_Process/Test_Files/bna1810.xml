To what extent do you agree with this statement? Provide reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic and infrastructural planning in india growing day-by-day.The companies with high technology and more talent was improving in today generation infrastructural as ther are many companies around us but every company was in competition to each other. The advantages of this economics and infrastructural are giving many young people to growth there skillls in different sectors. In India the growth had raised because the goverment provided many ways and helped them to grow faster and faster and the goverment allowed many funds towards it . Sometimes in these type of sectors they provided good advantages like health care. Giving advantages to the employees may help them to bond with them more freely and friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages of economic and infrastructural planning is causing the employees more stressfull life. The private sectors are setting some high standard that even the employees will not reach them in ther level of skills. Because of these sectors the people in and around was getting tired off it . The enivorment should be like peacefull and silent it will keep the employee frsh mind to work without tensions. The goverment should be involve in the planning with more plans. For example see other countries the companies are more easy way of going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enivorment in the infrastructural planning should be with playing some activiates some times to stay fresh in their work and they should allow them to be in free in their work. As we are these free movement of space they fell free to work with longer hours. Outside world thinks work in these sectors is so much hard and with stress. In my way the economic and infrastructural planning should be more with easy to the people who are working in and around the area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:ChinaEconomicOutlookfo2013&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China`s economy these days have double digit growth according to the reports from past.Growth of &amp;nbsp;7.7 percent in first quarter was diappointing and many analysts were expecting 8-9 percent to revert. The goverment to reset expectations and it forecast this year growth will be 7.5 percent, a good deal lower than many private analysts had forecast recently. This is slower than the 7.8 percent growth in 2012 which is slowest range compare to 13 years. Premier Li Keqiang, in his speech in germany the growth for the remainder of the decade is even lower then the average 7.0 per year and it is far slower than the growth experienced from past two decade, Li indicated china is "entering a range of rsonable growth".china has become a more mature economy with declining labor force, he is probably right in setting more modest expectations.The growth 7.0 is not bad and it doubles the GDP in 10years, Li said that a combination of industrialization,urbanization,improvemaents in agricultural and investments in technology contributes to healthy growth and more market -oriented reforms he said that "for a very big economy ,this is not easy.the reforms remains uncertain and have been announced many government statements have to bui8ld support which is needd for reforms.China faces more risks, including local govt debt banking system, and in manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;weakness in export markets, in addition china have impact on export competitiveness, thereby7 leading in manufacturing capacity with a growth range bof 7-8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;further global integration in another area of change involves in china`s economic relationship with rest of the world and now it studies the Trans-Pacific Pact, an effort to create free trade involves in 12 countries like usa,japan,canada,mexico,peru,chlie,vietnam,malaysia etc.it involves in free markets with forign countries and free movements in price and good and credits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China &amp;ndash; Economic Outlook for 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fast can China grow? That is the question underlying much of the discussion about China&amp;rsquo;s economy these days. Clearly, double digit growth is not in the cards and may even be a thing of the past. Growth of 7.7 percent in the first quarter was considered disappointing, and, until recently, many analysts were expecting growth to revert to the range of 8&amp;ndash;9 percent. Yet now the government appears determined to reset expectations. The government has forecast that growth this year will be 7.5 percent, a good deal lower than many private analysts had forecast only recently. That is certainly slower than the 7.8 percent growth in 2012, which was the slowest rate of growth in 13 years. Premier Li Keqiang, in a recent speech in Germany, said that growth for the remainder of the decade will average an even lower 7.0 percent per year. Although far slower than the growth experienced during the past two decades, Li indicated that China is &amp;ldquo;entering a range of reasonable growth.&amp;rdquo; Given that China has become a more mature economy with a declining labor force, Li is probably correct in setting more modest expectations. Moreover, growth of 7.0 percent is not bad: It doubles the GDP in 10 years. Li said that a combination of industrialization, urbanization, improvements in agricultural productivity, and investments in technology can contribute to healthy growth, and that this requires more market-oriented reforms. He also said that &amp;ldquo;for a very big economy, this is not easy.&amp;rdquo; When and how such reforms will be implemented remains uncertain. While some reforms have been announced, many government statements have been relatively vague. With a new regime just installed, it could take some time to build the support necessary to implement much needed reforms. In the interim, China faces some risks, including the ramifications of large local government debt, considerable leverage in the shadow banking system, and weaker-than expected manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing weakness stems from weakness in export markets. In addition, rising wages in China are having an adverse impact on export competitiveness, thereby leading to an exodus of manufacturing capacity. Thus, even growth in the range of 7&amp;ndash;8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further global integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves China&amp;rsquo;s economic relationship with the rest of the world. China&amp;rsquo;s government now says it will study the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP), an effort to create a free-trade area in the Pacific Basin. Currently there are 12 countries involved in this effort: the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. If China joins the group, the TPP will collectively account for more than half of global GDP. Freer trade would entail not simply lowering tariffs and quotas, although this would be an important component. It would also involve freeing up domestic markets so that they would have to compete freely with foreign companies. From China&amp;rsquo;s perspective, this could be a positive development in that it would create pressure to privatize state-run companies, create a level playing field for the private sector, and allow free movement of prices of goods and credit. Still, agreement on the TPP is probably a long way off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
