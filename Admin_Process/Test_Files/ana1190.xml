Do you agree or disagree? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes, i agree with the statement that censorship is necessary.As we can see that these shows effect the public views.For the sake of the publicity and trp rating they are publishing unrelevant and unnecessaryt information.Many of the new channels and shows are for gaining knowledge but there are many shows which are showing unabused shows.This should be some agency that verify and ban these kind of shows.Mainly it effects the mindset of the youth.There should be some awareness programmes &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;TV shows and newspapers are for covering and giving information regarding what is going on around the world it is not about how the actress are dressing and what they are doing?.The main aim of any social media is to help the public to know the information and it is a mediator between the public and Government that gives up-to-date information to the public.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Tv shows should be banned that telecast unabused shows and reality shows that are no where useful to the public.Many of the people watch tv either for entertainment or for knowing the current scenario of the Government.So the main purpose of these media is defeated by these unrelated data.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Currently,we have more than 320 channels,among them news channels are almost 30-40 channels in different channels but who many of them are responsibly working for the welfare of the public is an biggest question mark..only few channels are telecasting the news and working responsibly.Many of them mainly concentrating on the publicity and how to increase there TRP rating.So telecasing media should concentrate more on the public views not on the publicity of there channels.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
