Do you think this brain drain is making the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer? Discuss the pros and cons of brain drain, and measures to check this phenomenon? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;yes! i feel that this kind of brain drain is making rich countries richer and poor counytries poorer.Because highly qualified people opting jobs in richer countries to enhance their profile interms of position,work,money,status ...etc with this their own home country loosing the person who is quite helpful to develop the country.And the quality of our education standards are utilised to develop the richer countries lik US with this &amp;nbsp;we are loosing &amp;nbsp;economy and employability of developing country. As we are seeing still our country is developing country interms of economy,business,growth,development, educatinational,....etc in all kind of divisions because well educated and highly propfessional people are moving towards the foreign countries to work and to contribute thier knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;With this brain drain developing countries like india loosing higly qualified people in their economy and lossing skillfull employess in order to decrese this ratio the government of india plays a major role by provinding them good positon, environment, work,salary in order to retain the employees to utilize their knowlegde and experince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The responsible persons of resolving this problem should do the survey in prior to take any decisions and corrective action. The results of the survey will enhance the person to take corrective action towards the problem &amp;nbsp;like they wil get to know what are loop wholes of problem and what are the alternative sollutions of resolving the probelm and who are the real competitors and what are propective strategies of competitors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The major reason for this kind brain drain is devaluating the person interms of his/her capabilites while providing the position, work and money. And the major criteria for dissatisfaction &amp;nbsp;is job satisfaction and they expect good intrinsic n extrinsic benefits from the company and correct perfomance appraisal towards their work and proper guidlines from the top management and motivation ...etc with this we can retain the elgible persons in our company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Generally highly qualified people are not showing intrest to work in developing countries due to this they are choosing developed coutries in order tobuild their carrier with this the country is loosing their own investment like this country is providing knowlege interms of education but its is not utilising in the proper way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In order to resolve this problem the government and industries must find out the reasons n try to provide the good satisfactory job profile to the eligble persons with this the develeping countrie can grow faster n becomes the developed country. Here youngster of the country plays a major role because they easily attaracts towards the richer contry job profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:SouthKorea2013EconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;SOUTHKOREA ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 2013:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The GDP growth rate of southkorea is is hit a two-year in se3cond quarter as compared to first quarter in construction,investment, and exports. But in investment sector the first quarter results are quite good with compare to the second quarter 2013, With this improvement fiscal stimulus measures and monetory policy easing had a infact to get a benifit out of low unemployment and to boost the real wages. however the infact is, a global tarde cycle moves up with the consumer sentiment on the exports and growth rates of china were declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Consumer senti,ment n industrial output improved the economic condition of the southkorea in 2013. Industrial production is incresing year by year with 1.7% with compare to two previous trasactions. And the managers expanding the manufacturing activity at the fastest pace of two years by enhancing &amp;nbsp;new orders in both domestic and foriegh contries. This was quite improved in second quarter while compared to the first quarter 2013. The performance was quite good and index is by 2 points in april and it matched with high records of march. and with incresed rate of index its get benefited consumption growth declined the low inflation and low unemployment. Finally both investment and consumption benefited from fiscal stimulus plan and policy easing. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In may the south korea expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. This results in 1.8% raise in GDP in 2013 from previous 0.3%. &amp;nbsp;However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The infaltion in this year is low in may and well below its target rate of 2.5 to 3.5%. and tha bank of korea rated by 25 basis points in may to raise the growth and to prevent the southkorea n currency against the japanese yen. In the span of 6 months the won was quoted more than 20 % against the yen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; IN 2013 the southkorean breaked the trend towards the infaltion, unempolyment, GDP...etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
