Discuss three key factors for making `Make in India` a reality.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;india which is one of the most emerging counties in the world with a lot of corporate as well as manufacturing companies starting.their are a lot of companies in manufacturing feild which are very rapidly increasing in india.fisrtly, making india most&amp;nbsp; be a dream for the development of the country.a dream of introducing the manufacturing companies to india and then developing the manufacturing compaies in order to develop the employemnent in the country.in recent times india is improving to enter into all types of feild among which manufacturing feild is one. manufacturing in india is increasingly developing.the already exsisting manufacturing compaies like leather industry ,automanufacturing industry is improvingly increase in the indian market economy.making india a manufacturing hub can first be a dream and then can change that dream into a practical possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; making india a manufacturing hub,can be a dream.for few individuals making india a manufacturing hub can be just a dream because of few resons like low availability of labout or even expencive labour cost. other resons can also be market trend in those area.and the foremost and important is the capital and place to starts a manufacturing hub.for forieng manufacturing companies entering into the manufacturing feild in india can be just a dream without any praticial possiability due to the import and export rules and regulations and the requirements of the citizens of india .through different business strategies and supply chain managements a manufacturing industry can change their dream of making india a manufacturing hub into a pratical possiabllity byt appling some different strategies and ideas.make in indi awhich was introduced by the goverment of india is the key practice to change indian economy from low to high,poor to rich all the manufacutring companies of india must be able to joins their hands togehter to convert it from a dream to a partical possiability.this can only happen when the availability of the requied raw materials, labour,place and etc., are vastly available to the manufacturing industries in india making in india must be praticaly possiable only when their is a need of that particular product in the country.makingh india a manufacturing hub gradually decreases the impoert and export cost and also decreases the product cost wich inturn will be available for the average and below average level of citizens.if their is need a particular&amp;nbsp; product in india ,automatically their will be a need of a manufacturing company to establish in the country to help the customer recive the&amp;nbsp; products in door steps with out any delay.if a company is unable to fullfill the requirement of the customer then&amp;nbsp; their manufacturing the products will remain as a dream in india.by introducing products into the markert of india, the manufacturing industry will be able increase their market share in the market of indian economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;making `make in india` reality is increasingly emerging in the indian economy through maney factors and ideas.one of the main key factor in making make in india a reality is startup companies which are rapidly increasing in our country with eifferent range of innovations and ideas .startup is the main important key element in the comtext of&amp;nbsp; make in india concept. in india their are different startup hubs which helps the innovators to start a comapany in india .we can find many invertors who are interested in inverting the startup companies in india.it`s a hub for every individual who&amp;nbsp; want to start a business with htheir innovative ideas and startegies. it help the startup&amp;nbsp; companies to enter into the global market which helps in increasing the indian economy in the global market placenow a days their are many startup companies which are growing very rapidly in the market. startup&amp;nbsp; compaies help the indian economy to enter into the global market with a high share value in the country.goverment of india has proposed various schems and project with help the startup companies to come forwead and start a businnes in india.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; and the second key factor for making make in india a reality is marging or acquiring the companies internally or externally within or out side india.if a company is unable to&amp;nbsp; run its business properly in the indian market and any related company is running good in the market ,then the company which is running good can aquire the loss company to expand its business in the market.merging and aquiring of a company in thye marke will help the developing companies to compete with the other companies in the global market.merging with other developed compoanies can increase their space in the market. merging with other companies will help the startup companies to enter into the market very easily with out any obligations. merging with international companiy is al so a key element in making make in india&amp;nbsp; a reality as it will help them to introduce the forieng products in india.which will inturn develop the market share of india in the global market.merging and aquisition helps the indian market to produce different goods and services within india which will help to make india a developed india rather than developing county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; the last key factor to make `make in india` a reality is by introducing a new product (exsisting or new) in the market which will satisfy the need of the customer a broader sense.by introducing a new product in the market&amp;nbsp; customer satifaction will increace accordingly.introduction of new productes will help the company to enter into the market and be a lead in the market place. a product can be of a small or big but it must satisfy the customer in the growth stage in the product life cycle. this helps the company to not to enter in the declain stage of the product.once the product is satifying its customers it will automatically be in the lead in the global market.which inture help the indian marktet to increase its space in the international market place.a new product in the market can play a key role in making `make in india` a reality with success .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;global smart grid vendor landscape in changing and the markets are growing in countries like Europe, north america, east asia which are developd.large vendors provide solutions with the smart metering value chain where as the providors of communication and data analytics are highly active around the multiple smart grid segments,which helps in increasing the coordination between smart metering,home enargy management and distribution automation.in developing market countire3s like south asia, europe, africa,southeast asia,the market just started to develop.loads of local vendors started to&amp;nbsp; provide smart grid projects in partners with huge international firms and also by their own.the rates projected for smart grid projects in developing countires are high which shows the future of vendor activity and opportunity.the differences between the consolidating international smart grid adn smaller local player helps to increase the speed and the direction of smart grid in the globe.this study help toknow about the trends that are changing the shaoe of the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are increasing their stategies to be succesfull.this includes 500 vendor who are active in smart grid projects around the world and give4s importance in growing regionsand market segments and also helps to evaluate the exsisting partnersships, mergers and aquicitions that are deleting the smart grid markets.the investment of smart grid will reach $380.1 billion in over 125 countires between 2015 and 2025.the main objective of the study is to give a brief presentation about the competative landscape of the hundreads of vendors who are opting fo rthis growing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; the leading emerging market countires in terms of smart grid developemnt is brazilian smart grid market. positioning it self&amp;nbsp; as afifthe largest population in the world and te governament , trying to improve the country`s infrastucture in amodern form, brazil will soom become one of the smart grid market in the word in no time period.the smart grid development of of brazil indicates the strong underlying market conditions and a positive govenament action.among the developing market countries , brazil is topeped with the highest rates of non technical distributions losses,asumung that utilities will develop immediate revenue protection benefits by smart meter deployments.brazil is arapidly increacing economy, which is starting to strain the existing infrastucture.as it develps the reliability and energy savings benefits of smart grid will be important accordingly. in 2009 the brazilizn governament has taken in notice and set a non binding target of replacing all 63 million already existing&lt;br /&gt;electromechanical meters with smart meters by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in august 2012, the brazilian governament has announced a opt in smart meter regulation for existing customers,merging with a mandate requirinf smart meters for all new customers.it was not a expecting one for the binding mandate to replace all 63 milllion exsiting legacy meters with smart meters..by this northeast group is currently expecting that brazil will not be able to meet its 63 million meter targets but some some giovernamnet officials and regulators are expecting that the main goal can be reached ,which inspires the future incentives structure and more helpfu;; metering regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with strong economic and political conditions it is known that brazil`s smart grid market will increase rapidly int he upcoming decade.bu the main question here is that how fast deployemnets will take place. with the merging of new meter installations smart meters targets to reduce the non twchnical losses, and customers cant wait to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications,over hals of the brazilian homes will be having the smart meters by the end of the decade.moreover, the august 2012 regulations was unable to concrate mandate needed fo rbrazil to meet its main goal of 63 million meters by 2021.however, brazil remains a very specific smart gride market for both vendors and customers at the3 same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms. With high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors and smaller, more fragmented local players will help shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. This study takes a comprehensive look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positioning themselves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across all regions of the world, highlights growing regions and market segments, and assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions that are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries, smart grid investment will reach $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. This study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of the hundreds of vendors competing for this growing market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market &amp;ndash; An Insight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development. With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action. Like many emerging market countries, Brazil has high rates of non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also has a rapidly growing economy, which is beginning to strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it&amp;nbsp; set a non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However,&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; August&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2012, the&amp;nbsp; government&amp;nbsp; announced&amp;nbsp; an&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;opt--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;in&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meter&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; regulation&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; customers,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Paired with&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; requiring&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; new&amp;nbsp; customers.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp; was&amp;nbsp; not&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; anticipated&amp;nbsp; market&amp;nbsp; catalyst&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; those&amp;nbsp; expecting&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; binding&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; replace&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million existing legacy&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; result,&amp;nbsp; Northeast&amp;nbsp; Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its initial 63 million smart meter target. Yet, some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be achieved, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;With strong underlying economic and political conditions, it is inevitable that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade. The question is simply how fast deployments will take place. Through a combination of new meter installations, smart meters targeted at reducing non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt; technical losses, and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications, more than half of Brazilian homes will have smart meters by the end of the decade. However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
