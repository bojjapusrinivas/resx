<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/24/2013 3:56:32 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Significance of Ethics in Sports? Do you think betting in IPL should be legalized to avoid recent match fixing scams? Elaborate with reasons&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="3"&gt;As the red leather ball made contact with the bat, the batsmen swinging with all his might proving himself to be more than a player-a patriot playing for his country, serving his country equivalent to a soldier fighting on the border and as the ball soars along with it soars the excitement and dreams of the millions of Indians who had been watching the all the action on the field with baited breath.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt;The screams were defeaning as the ball crossed the defining sixer line and the contented smile on the batsmen face is the defining moment-he plays for his country, his people and then lastly for himself.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;These are the moments the Indians lived for,what with Kolkata going crazy evreytime the world cup came around the corner. Their excitement can be&amp;nbsp;sensed from&amp;nbsp;all the &amp;quot;Puja&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; they performed, the cheek&amp;#39;s streaked with the Inidan tri-colour,&amp;nbsp;the jam backed household&amp;#39;s, the silent,empty streets. However a lot has changed in the Indian Cricket scenario- a game of the masses, a game with which every Indian is besotted since Kapil Dev made India score its very first World Cup win. The game has undergone a lot of commercialization and with the commercialization it lost its morality.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;What are ethics but a moral compass pointing towards a players moral standards. Every sport has their own code of conduct, be it Hockey, Athletics, Tennis etc. Its the player who makes the game what it is with his values and sportsman spirit that he instils in the game. Ethics which the player&amp;#39;s bring into the game along with their passion and&amp;nbsp;energy makes a game what it is. A player&amp;#39;s excitement feed the game and so does his greed. Recently the commercialization of sports has led to a decline in the ethics that are associated with them. Earlier a player played for the love of the game now they play for the love of money. Cricket especially is thought to be the most lucrative of all what with all the sponsorships coming its way at the cost of other Indian sports. IPL only enhances the mentality that goes like this: &amp;quot;cricket has a lot of money&amp;quot;. The love for the game is gone replaced by&amp;nbsp;an ethic destroying emotion: Greed. IPL is a major example. The auctioning of the player&amp;#39;s already&amp;nbsp;pays them off very well but apart from that they receive hefty amounts for playing and then&amp;nbsp;we have the (in)famous after-match parties that introduced a new trend in the Indian Cricket scenario, the trend of splurging on the&amp;nbsp;already over-paid, over-pampered cricket player&amp;#39;s while the other Indian sport player&amp;#39;s suffer in the dark-silently.&amp;nbsp;And as if this was not enough to demotivate other Indian sports and corrupt Cricket further the concept of match fixing came into the scenario. This trend came into view with the accusation of the then heartthrob of Indian cricket-Ajay Jadeja and instead of diminishing and going extinct (even after the huge uproar the Ajay Jadeja scam caused) it has not only survived but flourished. Match fixing, earlier limited to dingy &amp;quot;Chaul&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; or a gangster&amp;#39;s den,but now it has spread to school&amp;#39;s corupting even the innocent minds forming a lucrative noose around innocent children&amp;#39;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The very idea of legalizing betting in IPL is just a polite way of letting the tradition of match fixing continue but under the garb of the law. Legalizing it is sending a very clear but a wrong message that this wrong, unlawful practice is right. Legalizing it is just another way of letting greed rule and ethics lose. Legalizing it is just another way of saying that it was never illegal in the first place. How can something that was wrong become right just because the law says so? We are glamorizing this sport and turning it into an overstuffed pig and just like it the effects can be seen- lazy, non-serious attitude of the player&amp;#39;s and the loss of the passion that is the backbone of every sport. Legalizing this so-called &amp;quot;betting&amp;quot; is like feeding the termites that have been gnawing into the very backbone of cricket and making it hollow, inside out. It is time to tighten the reins rather than loosening it and letting the horses of greed run rampant and crush the very soul of the only surviving and popular&amp;nbsp;Indian sport:&amp;nbsp;Cricket.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
