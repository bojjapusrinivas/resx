<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/24/2015 5:11:24 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The "TECHNOLOGY" is mostly improved by "COMPUTERS".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In the present generation, we are much used to computers. Everything is been dependent on the computer, it has been a very tremendous change in system of technology after the introduction of computers. The world is been working on computers for any kind of work, the work might be of any kind. Even in traffic lights system, the software is installed for the ligths to be indicated on the time procedures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;There is many advantages as well as disadvantages through this computers. Disadvantages like, most of the children are been addicted to this computers such as playing video games and wasting a lot there time on system. This makes the children to loss their `eye sight` and `valuable time`. With this the child loses their health and fitness. When the child is on the computer playings games, he/she wont have time to play in the grounds which makes with to fall ill. Playing in grounds make the child stay healthy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In city and township there is one computer in every house, either the use for the "parent" or for the "children". The performance of the computer is very effective, such as the information we get from the "World Wide Web"(Internet). People now a days are doing ther work from home. The companies are also giving the offer for the employee to sit at home and do the office work in the office timmings. The world will always "Dependent" on the "Computers". The computer has become the "Man`s Need" in their life, their is no such point where we can say that we don`t need a computer!!!!. Every now then their is time we need computer. In the computer we can handle various way to work out, such as MS Office, Editing videos and songs, Business work, Etc. Computer knowledge has become the first imporant preference to any candidate in every company. Any person without knowing the basic knowledge of computer is been rejected. So the the schools are making the children to learn about the computer right from there primary class. Shools are making them to learn by including the computere subject in there subjects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;I want to conclude that, people have become "DEPENDENT" on the computer. And the world is counting on the computers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:WorldAutoIndustryOutlookJune2013&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE AUTO INDUSTRY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auto industry has been developed a lot in the recent years, Its production is mostly to the U.S of 80% which of the rest is been to the other countries of the world. This makes the U.S of most fuel consumtion country. There are many Auto Indutries in the market, Every company is based on their own skills of making new kind of car`s. In them Toyoto has been awarded for the more sales than any other Auto Industries, has it has the sales of 9.75 million vechicles world wide in the year 2012.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automakers are now looking for shifting there prodution facilities to new regions based on the cost and demand factors. Developing the suppliers and the network of the production still makes the auto industry in great challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW TECHNOLOGY&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inventions in the company are on the bases of fuel, as the fuel is becoming less. the companies are trying to make green cars. the companies such as Toyota and Honda are well recongnised for green cars, and then comes the other ford and nissan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Govt of U.S has stated that the fuel resoures are becoming less, so inovate new hybrid cars. The industries has made some developmets in process of green technology. In January 2013, the U.S Department of Energy(DOE) backed off president Barack &amp;nbsp;Obama`s stated goal of putting 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;World Auto Industry Outlook - June 2013 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Although automakers continue to focus on shifting their production facilities to new regions driven by cost and demand factors, developing the supplier networks remains one of their greatest challenges. Existing suppliers to automakers often lack the financial strength to expand capacity in new markets. On the other hand, auto parts suppliers are sensitive to technology transfers to local third parties, which can give rise to low-cost competitors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;High dependence on automakers makes the auto market suppliers vulnerable to several maladies, primarily pricing pressure and production cuts. Pricing pressure from automakers constricts parts suppliers` margins. On the other hand, production cuts by automakers driven by frequent market adjustments negatively affect their operations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Future of Green Cars Looks Bleak &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Rising fuel prices and global warming have turned attention to the auto industry that either rely less on traditional fossil fuels or use cheaper renewable sources of energy. Despite the U.S. Government`s continued effort to promote "green" alternatives such as fuel-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles, things look bleak, at least in the near future. Globally, the hybrid market is ruled by Toyota (which includes the Prius) and Honda (includes Civic and Insight hybrids). Meanwhile, other automakers such as Ford, General Motors and Nissan are also aggressively pursuing a plan to push hybrid sales. Some of the well-recognized "green" cars include the Ford Focus, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf and Daimler AG`s ( DDAIF ) smart USA micro EV. U.S. is the largest hybrid car market in the world with sales accounting for 60%-70% of global hybrid sales. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However, the industry has witnessed some notable adverse developments in the drive for green technology. In January 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) backed off President Barack Obama`s stated goal of putting 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015 due to weaker than expected demand for plug-ins/EVs. According to Hybridcars.com, plug-in/EV sales constituted a meager 3.3% of the overall sales in the U.S. in 2012. The weak demand for plug-ins/EVs has led some lithium-ion battery makers file for bankruptcy protection in 2012. They include MA-based A123 Systems Inc. and NY-based EnerDel, despite both being DOE grant recipients (A123 - $249.1 million; EnerDel - $118.5 million). It also led another DOE grant recipient (in fact, the third largest with $161.0 million), Dow Kokam, to be written down by chemical behemoth Dow Chemical ( DOW ), who jointly operated the entity with TK Advanced Battery LLC since 2009.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
