Figures suggest that the top 10 leading manufacturers of automobiles were the leading retailers as well as their sales comprised around 80-90% of the total market share in the US.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;By the end of May 2013 General Motors Co was leading the stakes with around 18% of the total market share. Ford Motor Co followed closely with 16.4% of market share.Toyota Motors Corp came in third with around 14.2% share.Carysler Fiat, Honda Motor Co(HMC) and Nissan Motor Co(NSANY) followed with 11.7% , 9.5% and 8.1% shares respectively.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Toyota Motors Corp however stole the thunder from GM Co by exceeding their sales by 0.41 million vehicles. Germany&amp;#39;s Volkswagen AG(VLKAY) followed them with a whopping 9.07 million vehicles sold in that year.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Making hay while the Sun shines-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;In order to survive the cut-throat competition, these auto giants need to serve both existing as well as nascent markets keeping the production cost minimal using latest technologies.For instance, Ford&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;One Manufacturing Strategy&amp;quot; targets several prototypes from global factories to save the production costs and to adhere to the local needs. This&amp;nbsp;gimmick has&amp;nbsp;extended their low profit margins from&amp;nbsp;smaller cars to larger trucks.&amp;nbsp;They aim to produce 4.5 prototypes at these factories by the year 2015.The strategy has increased their production by 0.9 prototypes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fuel efficiency remains another crucial factor which determines the fate of the automobile industry.Hence, they are focusing on offering more customised features which provide better mileage. The manufacturers have diversified their businesses to cheaper economies such as India, China and South America. These regions have shown more than 50% of growth in the global light vehicle category over a period of seven years ie from 2008 to 2015.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;The macroeconomic policies of different countries also influence the strategies of the car makers.As a result of this in the year 2011, thirteen of the major auto giants including Ford, GM, Chrysler, HMC, TM, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, BMW and Volvo have entered into agreements with the US Authorities to maximise the fuel efficiency of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon(mpg) by 2025.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don&amp;#39;t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;June 2013 &amp;ndash; Global Auto Industry Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;In the first five months of 2013, General Motors Company ( GM ) led with a 18.0% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. ( F ) with a 16.4% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. ( TM ) with a 14.2% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 11.7% market share, and Honda Motor Co. ( HMC ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( NSANY ) at the last spots with 9.5% and 8.1% market shares, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM&amp;#39;s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany&amp;#39;s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;OPPORTUNITIES &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;To remain competitive, the automakers will need to design vehicles that will cater to consumers in both mature and emerging markets while manufacturing them at low-cost using the most advanced technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;For example, Ford has undertaken &amp;quot;One Manufacturing&amp;quot; strategy, which aims at producing multiple models from plants across the world in order to save production costs and fast adaptation to changes in consumer tastes. The automaker anticipates producing 4.5 models at each of its plants by 2015, up from 3.6 models currently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;Further, the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features (which will save money on gas), even on the small and less gas-guzzler vehicles in order to attract buyers. The sale of optional features is helping them offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to large trucks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;The automakers continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. According to a study by CSM Worldwide, China and South America together will represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;The role of governments is highly significant. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years. In late 2011, 13 major automakers, including Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Volvo, have signed letters of commitment with the U.S. Government to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
