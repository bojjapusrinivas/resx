<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:30:02 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes. I do agree that there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. There is a&amp;nbsp;lot of requirements for the healthcare especially in rural areas but the fact is that they are not getting the proper service. People are facing lot of problem, even for&amp;nbsp; small fever, they need to move away from their location to reach hospitals and even if they reach, the service is so expensive that the people cannot afford it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There are some healthcare services where there&amp;nbsp;are no basic facilities like a room, beds,equipments etc. Even in case of emergencies, the management make the people wait till they complete filling the application forms and in the mean time, the patient may become more serious. In many healthcare services, there&amp;nbsp;is no proper equipment for carrying out surgeries because of which the patient is made to travel abroad for the surgery. Every year, we see many people dying because of&amp;nbsp;no proper&amp;nbsp;treatment and most of them are from rural areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Government is also taking major steps to improve the service. For example, I recently read in a newspaper that the students of Kerala Engineering college visited a Government&amp;nbsp;hospital and they did a very good job by cleaning the hospital, they also&amp;nbsp;painted the rusted beds which&amp;nbsp;they found it&amp;nbsp;in a store room&amp;nbsp;that was not being used for many years.&amp;nbsp;So, I feel this should be implemented in every college as a part of their academics. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;next step which the Government can&amp;nbsp;take is encouraging the students to opt for medicine and also increase the number of medical colleges. Since studying medicine is very expensive, the merit students should be provided with scholarships and also the college should be provided with good laboratory so that they can practise well and come out with good knowledge.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We see many lands of Government here and there which is clear so instead of making it a garbage place, I feel Government can build healthcare services in such empty land. They should also visit rural areas and create a health camp at regular intervals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Government should recognize what are the basic requirements&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and in every healthcare service, it should be made mandatory to provide such services. Any healthcare service which is not providing the mandatory services should be liable to actions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Number of ambulance service also should be increased and Government should create a helpline where the patient&amp;#39;s problem can be found and they should provide them with information of nearest healthcare, where they can be treated well etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; Hence, by effective implementation of these steps, I think the healthcare supply would meet the demand.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
