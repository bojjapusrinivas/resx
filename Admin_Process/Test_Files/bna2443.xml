Trains are one of the way of transportation mode.In india trains are monitored by the Indian railways i.e central government. It is used for travelling from one place to another place. In traditional days we have used coal trains that are runned by using coal but by running the coal trains the air which is released from the trains are very harmful to the human beings and environment gets polluted.The infrastructure and facilities were not available at that time. Due to advancement in the technology the normal trains were introduced.The trains which we are using today are more better than the previous one. The facilities available in the trains are air conditioning ,food facilities and washroom facilities etc. The facilities in the normal train has to be improved like in the terms of infrastructure, emergency hospital facilities etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Bullet trains are the trains that are runned by using the electricity.These trains are used for faster transportation from one place to another place.These trains are manufactured with more advance features than the normal trains. The bullet trains are more comfortable when compared with normal trains. In this type of trains the train starts with an electrric button no need of human involvement. The bullet train have facilities like automatic door system, centralized air conditioning etc.This type of railway system requires more better infrastructure and technology.These type of trains are now using in japan,china and some other countries.The china is using bullet trains because they are fast developing countries in terms of technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullet trains can be introduced in India but still it is an developing country. The people from rural areas cannot afford for bullet trains so they usually prefer normal trains for transportation. The technology in IT sector, infrastructure, manufacturing and development are now growing better. To implement bullet train system we have to get funds from the government. the government can`t release huge funds for railway sector because it has to develop in all the fields but the bullet trains can be implemented in metropolitan cities because the people in those cities are moving in a faster phase and they can save their time by travelling through bullet trains. The infrastructure and technology is more available in cities rather than villages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;So according to me India needs both bullet trains as well as better trains. The bullet trains must be established in metropolitan cities and connected through all the cities.so that these trains can be used by the people who can afford for the higher prices and normal trains can be used mostly by rural people as well as urban people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
