&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The government of India, as part of its international commitment to save the envirnment, has taken a decision to ban single-use plastic across the country. The&amp;nbsp;sudden and drastic decision has impacted the daily lives of almost every section of the socety, as plastic has become a uboquitous and an inextricable item. So naturally like&amp;nbsp;a couple of&amp;nbsp;decisions the government of India has taken abruptly by surprising evryone inthe country this too has evoked a lot of anger and controversy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uasage of plastic is wide spread and there is no other economical alternative to replace it at the moment, this is main reason for a lot backlash for banning it.&amp;nbsp;The govrnmet on its part has not&amp;nbsp;given any tangible time frame for banning plastic. People from all walks of life irrespective of whether they are rich or poor got affected by the sudden decsion, as the single-use plastic uasge has become part of their lives. People are so habituated to plastic uasge that they are now finding it really difficult to get rid of it. The difficulty to get rid of plastic is not just lies on consumer side even some manufacturers are also finding it harsh as there is no other economic and cheaper alternative to replace plastic packaging. A lot of food and other products, and beverages come with plastic packaging. So the ban will definitely affect their market drastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, the public and business people`s outcry on banning plastic may be reasonable to some extent, but the government for the sake of safeguardng our environment has to take some unpleasant and non-popular decisions. It is a universally proved truth that plastic degardes our environment and is primarily responsible for several health hazards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always a way if we have strong will. So in order to get rid of plastic monster and to save our economy too, a balanced approach is necessary. It is a fact that plastic is not safe - therefore public at large shuld understand its evil effects and voluntarily disrobe it.The government should give manufacturers especially medium and small scale players some incentives to swith over to environment-friendly packaging methods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of late, there is an increase in market&amp;nbsp;for mobile handsets which have over 5 inches screens, but this tendency however has not affected the sale of larger tablets. The size of an average smart phone display was 2.6 inches way back in 2007, which now stands at 4.9 inches. The primary reason for the phone screen growth is reduction in making voice calls using phones and using the device more often like portable computers.&amp;nbsp; This evident from the data which shows that a typical person has spent 720 minutes in a month&amp;nbsp; on a phone making calls in 2011, while the time spent on making calls came down to 673&amp;nbsp;minutes in 2013.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The trend for larger screen phones has taken on market space of tablets and occupied almost 40 per cent of the global smartphone market during the first quarter of 2014. The phones&amp;nbsp;with 5 inches dispaly are mainly preferred by people who want use it to replace laptop usage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing demand for larger dispaly phones however may not affect the sale of small tablets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Growing interest in phones with screens over 5 inches is going to reduce sales of small tablets. It won&amp;rsquo;t noticeably cut into the market for larger tablets, however.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In recent years, the size of phone screens has grown dramatically. The average smartphone display measured 2.6 inches in 2007, and is now 4.9 inches. Partially driving this has been a steady decrease in the time spent making voice calls &amp;ndash; a typical person spent 720 minutes a month talking on a cell phone in 2011, but 673 in 2013. As people come to use these devices as portable computers more than simple mobile phones, larger screens have become more valuable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;This trend has reached the point that handsets large enough to rival tablets made up about 40% of the global smartphone market in the first quarter of 2014.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Small tablets are typically sold to people who want a light-duty computer with a display that&amp;rsquo;s larger than the one on their phone but is more portable than a laptop. The growing numbers of people who get a phone with a screen over 5 inches in size will see little need for a device with a screen that&amp;rsquo;s barely any bigger than their phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;For example, the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch display that will inevitably reduce demand for the iPad mini which has 7.9-inch screen because their functionality overlaps. If you&amp;rsquo;re just checking email and social networks, what would be the point in buying both?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Demand Has Changed, Not Stopped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Increasing interest in larger phones won&amp;rsquo;t kill off all demand for small tablets. After all, many people won&amp;rsquo;t want to carry a phablet and will still see a need for a larger tablet at home or office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Families may also keep small tablets from dying out completely. Many parents buy small, inexpensive tablets without service plans for their children. Parents are also more willing to give a sub-$200 tablet to a child than a phone, many of which cost over $500 to replace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;No matter what happens to small tablets, many market watchers do not expect demand for full-size models like the iPad Air to be affected by growing sales of phablets. IDC &amp;ldquo;expects more consumers to shift back toward larger-sized tablets with their next purchase.&amp;rdquo; Meanwhile, the Motley Fool wrote that the release of the iPhone 6 Plus &amp;ldquo;could ultimately drive mix up from the lower-cost iPad mini models and toward the full-sized iPads.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;While there are some tasks that can be performed equally as well on a 5- to 6-inch screen as on a 9- to 13-inch one, there are many others that require more real estate. As examples, while someone could use a 5.7-inch Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or a 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab 4 to order a pizza or Google an actress&amp;rsquo; filmography and have the same experience, but the full-size tablet offers significantly better functionality for watching a movie or writing a report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The line that people have drawn between phones and tablets is blurring, and maybe even fading. While screen size certainly varies over a wide range, both types of devices are small, slate-shaped computers without physical keyboards. One of the few remaining differences is that one type can make phone calls and the other can&amp;rsquo;t, but with FaceTime and Google Hangouts, does that really matter these days?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
