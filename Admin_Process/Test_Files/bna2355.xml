<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;11/23/2016 2:41:24 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss the pros and cons of the Indian Government&amp;rsquo;s action plan for demonetization of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes. What would be the long term impact of this step on terror financing and creation of unaccounted wealth?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;This would immediately curtail the funding of terrorist outfits, Hawala transactions and all the illegal activities and creation of unaccounted wealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;As the indian government is facing a lot of flack from countries, Where unaccounted wealth can be stashed and are not sharing the same information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt; with&amp;nbsp;our government and running into deadlock situations, It would be proper to at least stop the generation of this kind of wealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;This should also put a stop to the illegal accumalation of party funds and spending exhorbitantly without the knowledge of election commision unethically&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;thus misguiding rural people at large by enticing them with money and liquor for their benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;By taking this step if at all there were benefits galore towards a very critical juncture, It must have been done with impeccable planning without creating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;furore and putting the entire rural and poor population into quandry, Making their lives miserable for one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Even the urban people are put to hardships as it has become imperative for them to stand in the que after retiring from work without the certainity of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;a fruitful transaction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;If this exercise is beneficial to the common people, then the same should have been put forth infront of the entire nation so as to pacify them&amp;nbsp;and make them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;understand the futility of the situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Refraining from all theese activities and just by declaring that black money would sieze to exist and good for all citizens is a very poor stategy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Also the magnitude of the effect it is going to have over the economy during this entire exercise should have been put forth to all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The basic terms remaining the same on the ground level, How could the introduction of 2000 rupee note going to change and cleanse the entire &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;system&amp;nbsp;from accumalating illegal wealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Last but not the least a exercise of this magnitude where the entire population has to participate and undergo difficulties of various nature, Losing lives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;in the process is not justified because of the inefficacy of the government in executing it without a proper plan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Due to the shift of number of people living in the cities being 34 percent in 1960 to 54 percent in 2014 throughout the world, all the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;cities will also appreciate a growth of 1.8% in population every year during 2015 - 2020 by estimates done. This calls for more number of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;high-rise buildings than horizontal spread as this area is limited. This results in demand for highly efficient and ergonomic elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Global companies dealing with elevators are concentrating more over the ergonomics and intelligent capabilities to sustain the competition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;ThyssenKrupp has installed capacity of more than 1.1 million elevators which it manages using cloud capabilities in its systems to garner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;valuable systems and sensors data for improving their maintenance and service. Utilizing intelligent destination dispatch technology system &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in lousiville and the Cresent in Dallas, where elevators were installed successfully by Schindler Elevator corporation into the buildings. Also modernization and installation of its&amp;nbsp;PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza Office building, Puerto Rico was done in 2014.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The market for intelligent and ergonomic elevators is expecting a sharp growth, which is also fuelling modernization of older systems&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;already existing the market will experience a high growth by 2020. The modernization expenditure expected in developing asian countries by installation of intelligent elevators could take mammoth proportions by 2020. &amp;nbsp;Approximately 53 % of the worlds high-rise structures are budding in china itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;This accruing number of High-Rise buildings world wide, Green Infrastructure standards and statutory pre-requisites tiding over for&amp;nbsp;mandatory&amp;nbsp;installation&amp;nbsp;of inelligent elevators in new and existing infrastructures. World Wide increasing number of High-Rise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;buildings has accelarated the requirement for quick, efficient, safe and cozy elevator systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Untill now U.S, U.K, Canada, and France were a large contributor to the intelligent elevator market due to modernizaton of old&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;systems creating revenue. But from now on newer high-rise buildings will install intelligent elevator systems resulting in higher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;amount of income and also over grow the modernization demands to reach a market value of 52 % for intelligent elevators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;As with the growth of technology towards future systems addition of intelligence for communication, Access control and security&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;propels elevators to be designed specifically for cutomers typically being Commercial, Residential, Healthcare, Industrial and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Hospitalty etc,. Intelligent elevators can be tailor made for customers as per their requirement of usage to impart state-of -art&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Dependability, Cleanliness, Ambience, Travel and Stop contorl, Area and Coziness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The market appreciation for its increment growth in commercial usage would prove to be very profitable for intelligent elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Examples of commercial usages like Offices, Hotels, Lodges, Hospitals, Banks, Retail (Supermarkets &amp;amp; Shops), Theatres &amp;amp; Malls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Residential buildings have less traffic between the floors, Commercial buildings have more traffic between the floors, Healthcare Sector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Need deeper reach for carrying strechers, Malls, Multiplexes, Shops and Super Markets require Vandal proof products, thus the criteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;for Designing depends on &amp;nbsp;number of people to be carried, Material to be carried ie, strechers etc,. Apart from this big &amp;amp; travel coziness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;are also important in retail &amp;amp; warehouses. Elevators have to designed specicifically for their purpose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Due to the fact that elevators are power hungry &amp;amp; consume more in commercial buildings due to inter floor traffic, Resulting in large companies are inventing methods for optimal consumption of power but the same consumer experience as intelligent elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In advent to this Mitsubishi has developed a Multi-elevator intelligent technology to reduce power consumption by 10% approximately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Intelligent technology utilizes maximum energy reduction during passive hours &amp;amp; maximum efficiency when during peak hours of operation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
