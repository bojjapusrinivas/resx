What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My&amp;nbsp;view about India Health care is very low because&amp;nbsp;of not having proper facitilies and funds.&amp;nbsp;There is&amp;nbsp;so much&amp;nbsp;of demand but supply is very less, because of this India is having a major problem in Health care.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;Government should take certain actions&amp;nbsp;regarding this issues. It should pass a bill in assembly about the health care management system. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;One of the major&amp;nbsp;problem is not having proper&amp;nbsp;equipments for major operations.The government should take responsibility to import those equipments from other countries like US,JAPAN etc. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The second&amp;nbsp;problem is about Research and Development.&amp;nbsp;The government should&amp;nbsp;provide funds in Research and Development.Third&amp;nbsp;problem&amp;nbsp;is about&amp;nbsp;not having proper teaching staff and labs in Medical schools and colleges.The government should provide some funds so that there can hire and train the&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Which&amp;nbsp;I mentioned above if government&amp;nbsp;could improves those area there will be no gap between healthcare supply and demand in India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Thank you for giving this question,where i gave my opinion about health care system in India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
