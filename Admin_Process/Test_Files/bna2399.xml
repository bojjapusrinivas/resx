Some times bullet train is required to reach the destination very fastly. Better trains will helps us to reach our destination safely instead of reaching fastly. Sometimes India needs bullet train and sometimes better trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Bullet trains are used to help the people who are in emergency in going somewhere. The speed of the bullet is very high. It runs like a bullet. Because of the speed of the train it is named as a bullet train. The disadvantage is that high speed is very dangerous to the lives of the people. It can take the passengers to their destination but there is no guarantee for safety. Safety is a very important thing while travelling. The government should think about the safety of the passengers.And it also charges high cost for travelling in the bullet train. So,middle class people and low class people can`t buy the ticket. So,they won`t travell in the bullet trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Better trains are used to help the people in travelling safely when compared to bullet trains. Better trains will be available at less cost. So that, middle class people and low class people also can easily travel. It is also has some disadvantages like it will take more time for travelling. It has some less characteristics when compared to bullet train. We can travel from any place to any place with low charges. Better trains will run slowly so, the passengers may get fed up with the travelling. These trains are running over a long period of time. So, many people feel comfortable with travelling in better trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Being India is a developing country, now it is not that much easy to run bullet trains. Still the unemployment level is high in India and poverty is also very high. Corruption is also high in our country. There is a lot of black money is there so, to overcome all these issues we have to convert all the black money into white money. Then only there is a possibility for utilising the money in a right way. So that money can be used for developing our country. Then only we can run run the bullet trains and India needs it. Manufacturing of the bullet train requires lot of money and time. India doesn`t have that much ability to run bullet trains because India is still a developing country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Basically bullet train is suitable for rich people only. It will be more useful for the developed countries like America. In developed countries they needs to go to their office within time so there is a need of bullet trains for those employees and they are also able to pay that amount for travelling. But in developing countries like India the pepole can`t pay that much amount. Beacause they are not getting high salaries so, they would like to travel in better trains only. Better train requires less time and less cost for manufacturing. In bullet train we have ac. That will be very useful in the summer season. We can travel very comfortably when compared to better trains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Better trains are having their own benfits and bullet trains are also having their own benfits. So, Finally my opinion is that better trains are better for India. In better trains people can travel very safely with low cost. Whenever India become developed country then we can run bullet trains also. At that time the manufacturing of the bullet trains will not show much effect on the financial position of the country. Unemployment also will be reduced so, may be there will be high demand for the bullet trains. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
