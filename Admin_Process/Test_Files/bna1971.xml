To what extent do you agree with this statement? Provide reasons for your answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An area is said to be a well developed &amp;nbsp;when its economy and infrastructure is planned in accordance to the &amp;nbsp;prevaling needs of the residents of it and those plans are implemented by optimal utilization of the resourses they have. But at the same time , the plannig of economy and infrastructure should be done bearing in mind the environment conservation. I totally agree with the &amp;nbsp;statement, because in my view some &amp;nbsp;countries or areas which has been developed in terms of economic activites or providing business opportunities by the government ignoring the environmental issues are facing severe heaith hazards now. For example, China, one of the largest economies in the world and being the manufacturing hub of the large global companies situated &amp;nbsp;in developed countries is now facing air pollution to unberable extent. According to some reserch reports china`s &amp;nbsp;atmosphere contains carbon dioxide moore than that is acceptable for humans to live. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure planning like providing &amp;nbsp;housing needs, drinking water facilities &amp;nbsp;for the people in that area should be done in pace &amp;nbsp;with the growing population and water and land resourses available in that area. For example In hyderabad &amp;nbsp;hussain sagar or &amp;nbsp;musi river had been the &amp;nbsp;tank for drinking needs and agricultural activities for people living in and around the hyderabad. But because of poor planning which ignored &amp;nbsp;envioronmental conservation allowing sanition and industrial wastages in to the river, governments spoiled it. But now they are realising the fact that environmental conservation is one of the important issues which should be bearing in mind while planning a developmental activity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the name of industrial reforms or industrial freindly atmosphere, planners of an economy is giving away &amp;nbsp;forming lands to the industry entities. this has been turning useful forming lands into buildings and factories, because of which soil of the earth is becoming waste. And establishing factories near to the villages and lakes, rivers &amp;nbsp;is polluting &amp;nbsp;the atmospehre around them by releasing their industrial wastages into air and water. for example &amp;nbsp;Japan is facing the consequences of their nuclear industry activities where the people of japan now have to wear masks and oxyzen cylinders to survive in particular areas of japan. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy deforestation,acid rains, scarcity drinking water in some places, depletion of ozone layer are&amp;nbsp;some of&amp;nbsp;the consequences of negligence shown towards environmental conservation while planning infrastructure and economic activities. &amp;nbsp;Finally i conclude by saying that e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: small;"&gt;conomic and infrastructural planning of an area should be done bearing in mind the environment conservation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:IndiaEconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India, because of its economic policies and actions it adopted earlier, could save it self from the gobal financial crisis 2008 from hitting badly and it could recover it self faster than other economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth rate of indain economy is seized due to some domestic issues that are prevailing now in india. But india's long term growth may not be effected since the macro economic fundamentals it &amp;nbsp;had adopted. &amp;nbsp;focussing more on investing activity and constructing a favourable policies in the economy will work for economy to keep growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major highlights are from analysis are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;india may become &amp;nbsp;US$5 trillion economy &amp;nbsp; interms of its market size by FY20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because of the boost in service sector economy india's growth rate &amp;nbsp;may reach to japanese economy during its 2010 in terms of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;increase in Investment activity wil help the economy grow to around 40.7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India Economic Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India remained remarkably resilient from the global economic turmoil in 2008 owing to its strong domestic fundamentals and had been one of the fastest economies to recover from the crisis. Currently, the growth momentum of the Indian economy has again been impacted. This time around besides the prevailing crisis in some of the developed economies, emergence of certain domestic issues had played a major role in restraining India&amp;rsquo;s growth momentum. However, we believe that India&amp;rsquo;s long term growth prospects will remain buoyant driven by its underlying strong macroeconomic fundamentals. We believe that emphasis on boosting investment activity and setting up of a favorable policy environment will act as a catalyst to unravel the growth potential of the Indian economy during the current decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The highlights of the analysis have been provided below &amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s macro-economic outlook 2020:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India is expected to be more than US$ 5 trillion (current market price) economy by FY20. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The size of the Indian economy will be comparable to the Japanese economy (in terms of GDP in US$) as of 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;We expect the current phase of subdued growth to continue till FY15 before the economy moves into a high growth phase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s economic growth during the current decade is expected to be driven by the buoyancy in the services sector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment activity is expected to accelerate going ahead, which will help the Indian economy achieve a higher growth rate. Share of investment to GDP will increase to stand at 40.7% of GDP during FY20 from 36.6% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Infrastructure will be both a cause and a consequence of economic growth during the current decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Strong growth in domestic savings will support domestic investment. The savings rate is expected to surge to 39.5% during FY20 from 33.8% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Under consumption, share of discretionary spending is expected to rise significantly to 70% of private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) as compared to 60.0% (P) in FY11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic growth drivers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Substantial investments in social and physical infrastructure will be the key growth drivers that will enable the economy to achieve &amp;lsquo;inclusive growth&amp;rsquo; over the current decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Infrastructure investment in the electricity sector is expected to account for 3.8% of GDP by FY20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment in physical infrastructure is expected to lead to employment generation, increased production efficiency, reduction in cost of doing business and improved standard of living which is expected to drive infrastructure investment (as measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation) to 11.5% of GDP by FY20 from around 6.0% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Increased government focus towards improving overall healthcare facilities is expected to enhance total government expenditure on healthcare to 2.2% of GDP in FY20, as against 1.3% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The share of the private sector in infrastructure financing is expected to increase from 39.4% in FY12 (P) to 48.0% in FY20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment in the agriculture sector is expected to grow to around 3.2% of GDP by FY20 as against 2.6% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
