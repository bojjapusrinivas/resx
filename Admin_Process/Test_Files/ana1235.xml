Even with a populatin of over 1.2 billion, India has still &amp;nbsp;not able to produce entrepreneurs like steve jobs and bill gates because most of the indian students after completing their graduation they are going to abroad for doing their masters, and they are stttled in abroad this is main reason for india has still not producing entrepreneurs like steve jobs and bill gates.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;		&lt;/span&gt;Indian &amp;nbsp;education system is also one of the main reason for it. Students are completing their studies and they are settled in jobs and they are not thinking about about extra income. For indian citizens, business thinking is less compared to other country people. Most of the indian&amp;#39;s are self satisfied with their income and they are not thinking about other plans to get an extra income. Most of indian&amp;#39;s are stoping their education at school level it is one of reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;		&lt;/span&gt;In india, most of the students are studying depending on their parents intrest and not on their self intrest. If parents wants to become their children as engineers and they are becoming engineers even they are not intrested in it. Where as in other countries parents spend money to their chilren&amp;#39;s education upto school level. After school level they will do what they wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;		&lt;/span&gt;Most of the indian citizen&amp;#39;s are not intrested in reaserch field and doing own business, i think this is one of the reason for india is not producing entrepreneurs like steve jobs and bill gates. Education is not only way to become an entrepreneur and without any backgroud also they can become an enterpreneur. With their own talent and intrest they can become an entrepreneur.For example Bill Gates without any background and higher studies he became an entrepreneur and he become an world&amp;#39;s richest man around the world.&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;		&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;		&lt;/span&gt;Even though india is not producing entreprenuers like steve jobs and bill gates we also have great entreprenuers. India is a day by day developing country. India is having many software companies and also many developed cities to show india is developed country. India is having many legends to become an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;		&lt;/span&gt;Even we are having most talented people, and most talented scientists, our indian government systen is not encouraging them in their reasearch field and it is also one of the reason for india is not still not producing entrepreneurs. These are are the reasons for india is not producing entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;		&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;		&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
