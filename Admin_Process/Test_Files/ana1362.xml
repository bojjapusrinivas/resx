<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;5/30/2014 4:05:41 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the demand for foreign brands overtaken that for our home grown brands? How do Indian brands fare internationally in the era of globalization?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;In the era of globalization each and every brand requires well planned marketing stragies. Like every nation Indian economy is entirely dependent upon how much India can market its products or brands globally. I believe the quality of the product and reliability are two major obstacles faced by the Indian brands, just for an example, Indian made cars can not market in the USA, Japan and UK since it failed the safety requirements of a standard car. Therefore quality of the product has to be competitive enough to even think about the good marketing plans to promote the product in a global range.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;However, India is always is the birthplace of cutting edge technologies, for example the &amp;quot;Apple softwares&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;were built by Indian engineers sitting back in Hyderabad, India but at that point no Indian business company was there to promote those products. Talking on the same note, today Indian business tycoons are making in billions sitting in the other countries if they have thought of investing in Indian market and boost the Indian economy then it would have been the real help for the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;Most of the best quality products India breed like tea, coffee, rice and etc. there marketing patents are own by USA, thus even if we grow certain quality products India is incapable of retain those industries. Although if we look from the global marketing point of view then every other developed countries opening their industries starting from pharmaceuticals to softwares in India, utilizing Indian resources, outsourcing their jobs but in reality they are encroching Indian market , filling with their products that outcompete Indian products.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;Even I strongly believe Indian products requires a vigorous marketing &amp;nbsp;and thorough research but I also hopeful that &amp;nbsp;Indian brands will outcompete International brands soon as our new government shows the actual power of marketing and how even you can sell people&amp;#39;s emmotion with the good stratigies.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
