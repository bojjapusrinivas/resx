Do you agree or disagree? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the twenty first century media is playing a very important role. We get connected to all over the world through media publishing and telecasting. we can know about every small information i.e.&amp;nbsp; like political, economical, technological, environmental, legal issues which is going on all over the world. There are many media publishing and telecasting channels influencing modern human life&amp;#39;s in many aspects. Through this media there are many pros and cons.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;First media publishing and telecasting channel came into picture was in early&amp;nbsp;19th century.&amp;nbsp;Doordarshan was the only channel used to be there at that time in India.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;People used to get all the information prevailing in the world from that channel. Now in this century there are many media publishing and telecasting channels. Some of them are ETV , CNBC, NTV, TV9, SAKSHI etc.&amp;nbsp;These media people are publishing all the news irresponsibly due to which many of the&amp;nbsp; people are committing suicide and many of them are doing crimes. For example if we take&amp;nbsp;swamiji&amp;#39;s case&amp;nbsp;media is&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;telecasting about swamiji&amp;#39;s mahimas ,&amp;nbsp;people are believing&amp;nbsp; swami&amp;nbsp;and offering many gifts to&amp;nbsp;swamiji&amp;#39;s. At the same time they are&amp;nbsp;telecasting that swamiji &amp;nbsp;is doing rasaleelas. Media should telecast some educational, business, world news so that people get knowledge about&amp;nbsp;all over the world.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;According to my point of view censorship is needed for the media publishing and telecasting channels. so that false information will not come out to the public point of view.Dirty pictures and videos will not be telecasted only important news will be telecasted it will be useful to&amp;nbsp;children, youth and&amp;nbsp;old age people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Media publishing and telecasting have both advantages and disadvantages. Thus, these channels are again gifts of science and technology when it handle with great care.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
