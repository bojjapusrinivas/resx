<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;5/24/2018 11:42:42 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the move to demonetize old 500 &amp;amp; 1000 rupees notes a good one? Suggest measures to be taken by the government to fine-tune the digital payment/cashless economy.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes the concept of demonetizing the 500 rupee and 1000 rupee note was a good step taken which has some benefits to common people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept demonetization was started ny PM Narendra Modi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages of cashless payment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) No need to carry the cash in hand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) No worry of theft&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) can carry the card anywhere everywhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Security issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Theft issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Misplacing the card&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* The government must give the surity of safe cashless payments l&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* They should ensure to people that the money will be secured&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* There should be privacy with the process or transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* GPS enable chip should be there so that we can get back the card when stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* People must feel free to use the app or the card while transacting&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* The process of transaction must be easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* The refund option should me provided in case of transacting to unknown&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cashless mode is very flexible to use if there is a strong security with the process. Government has to take the measures to secure the transactions made and are not hacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Markets are maturing in developed countries like North America, Europe, and East Asia. Several of large vendors now offer intergrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain. there is a active increase across the multiple smrat grid sgements by communication and data analytics providers which is also improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. In emerging market countries, the market is just began to grow across Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, The Middle East and North Africa, South Asia ans Southeast Asia. Many of the local vendors, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms started to serve smart grid projects. In emerging countries there is a high growth rates projected for smart grid projects which represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity.This study looks at the shaping the smart grid vendor landscape trends and how firms use strategies to succeed, the fragmented local players will help in shaping and direction of smart grid deployements across the globe and there is the dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors. Over 500 vendors are already active in smart grid projects all over the globe where the growing regions are highlighted and mrket segments that assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisition that are there in smart grid market. Between 2015 and 2025 over 125 countries the smrt grid investment will reach $380.1 billion. This study represents the competition between hundreds of vendors in this growing market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;Brazizlian Smart Grid Market - An Insight&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In emerging countries Brazil is the one of the leading country of smart grid development. brazil is the fifth largest population in the world and its government is eager to chnage the country`s infrasturcture modernly. Brazil`s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive goverment action so Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil country is high in non-techncal distribution losses, implying that utilities will reap immediate revenue protection benefits by smart meter deployments this country also has rapid growth in economy which is began to strain existing infrastructure. The country continued to grow, the reliablity and energy savings benefits of smart grid will increase and become important. The Brazil Government has taken notice, set up a non-binding target of replacing all 63 million existing electromechanical meters with smart meters by 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2012, the government announced an "opt-in" smart meter regulation for existing customers and mandate requiring smart meters for all new customers. Expecting a binding mandate to replace all 63 million exisiting legacy meters with smart meters is not anticipated by market catalyst. As a resuts, Northeast Group is currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its initial 63 million smart meter target. Yet, few government officials ar believing that they will reach the initial target and will inspire fuure incentive structures and more favourable smart metering regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazil`s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade with the strong economic and political conditions.The question is how fast deployement takes place- Through a combination of new meter installations, smart meters targeted at reducing non-technical losses, and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid application. More than half of the Brazilian`s will have smart meters in their home by the end of the decade. The August 2012 regulations has fallenl short that the mandate needed for Brazil to meet it`s target of 63 millions meters by 2021 and Brazil remained a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms. With high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors and smaller, more fragmented local players will help shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. This study takes a comprehensive look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positioning themselves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across all regions of the world, highlights growing regions and market segments, and assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions that are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries, smart grid investment will reach $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. This study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of the hundreds of vendors competing for this growing market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
