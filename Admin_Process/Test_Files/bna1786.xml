Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The topic Lucidly explains about a fact in world of modernialization that people are giving less preference about medical care. i completely agree with the topic. people today are neglecting medical care they think it as a least concern and they are seeing only things that are really important. so, medical care takes a back seat here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Today every individual should take initiative and have medical care check up atleast twice a month but people are going once a year this is not good for individual point of view and country point of view . i would like to say this is the main reason why medical industry have not been big in india. if you take other countries like usa, uk, australia where every one individual data will be maintened like when he came, what precreption are &amp;nbsp;given, when he returned again so all sort of individual activities are maintened in their data base but this is not the case in india. Here people go to hospitals which are less branded because people are not willing to pay huge bills to hospitals so they prefer hospitals which are reasonable. In india there is a taboo that &amp;nbsp;people who go to hospitals twice a month &amp;nbsp;are suffering from harmful diseases this is what others think.so i can say that this is the main root cause that people are not interested to have medical care.If an enterpreuner comes up with good business plan regarding medical care i think i would be good for entire country because if you take people who lives in country side they do not have many faclities in medicines and these people will die due to harmful diseases which are present in their areas so medical care here should be made mandotary. According to World health organisation report many people who die in india in early age suffered from diseases where medicines are not good and lack in quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;However, one may argue that developing countries are all facing this problems but i oppose that if government take certain measures and look close in this area this can be improved. Government should come up with good schemes so that &amp;nbsp;people will have faith in them and they will be forward to take the schemes. our prime minister narendra modi have launched many campaigns in various areas but in health sector he could not launch the main reason is that there is no support from our people if any scheme which is free people are eager to register but in medical sector they do not have faith and they think medicines here are less quality and have no effect on them. This belief should be removed by our prime minister and he have to launch a good schme where this sector should be benefitted. our government have kept 100% fdi in medical sector to boost this &amp;nbsp;sector and get good revenue from this sector. Rightnow, it is going well with insurance and i hope good days will be with medicine industry. Private hospitals should be combinedly work with government and make this sector fruitful. Good happens in this sector when both private and government work. If free medical checkups are in private hospitals then people will believe in this medical care and they will come forward. Government should take help of celebraties for advertising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; To sumup, i like to say that people should be taking medical care seriously as it very important to them and country and they should be trusting the government schemes regarding health care sector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
