The population of India is increasing day by day. The needs of the people are also increasing regularly with respect to their lifestyles. The need for transportation is also high as people are keen to explore themselves in different locations with their talent. The need for fast transportation is increasing rapidly because of the work culture adopted by people. The growing technologies in India is bringing modernisation in all the aspects of the life of the people. People are showing more interest in relocationg according to their needs. Now a days people are willing to travel around the world as part of vacations to experience the different lifestyles of different places. So the means for fast transportation is increasing day by day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Bullet train was the most prominent way of transportation which helped the people reach their destination in less time when compared to bus transportation. Bullet trains have the capacity of carrying hundreds of people at a time in required time limits. Bullet trains were prominent with their emphasised features. They are utilised for goods transporation also. The import and export activities have the great impact on Indian economy, so the railway transportion became useful in transporting goods. The goods transportion should be done in less time as the goods may exhaust with longer times so fast railway transportation helped alot to secure the goods and import or export within time limits. The cost and time of travelling is less when compared to bus transportation but the comfort in the bullet trains is not perfect for the passengers to travel long distance. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Few years ago Bullet trains were very efficiently used as that was the only fast railway transportation available in those days. In order to travel long distance in those days people have the only choice of using bullet trains though they feel discomfort. Emerging technologies&amp;nbsp;have brought many changes in trains which have many advantages. The improvements in the train stucture and the capacity which it can maintain has been increased. With increased mobility more number of trains are introduced which provide the passengers to travel from nook and corner of different places. Different types of comforts are being provided in the modernised trains which is attracting the passengers to opt for railway transportation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Bullet trains have few disadvantages such as it uses more amount of fuel, the sound of the train irritates the passengers which inturn leads to discomfort to the passengers. The time of travelling is less when compared to modernised trains. As India is a developing country, it needs most efficient&amp;nbsp;way of transportations with minimum time limits and which provide comfort to the passengers. It also helps the poor people in travelling with minimum fares.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;With this the modernisation of the country also takes place which satisfies the needs of the people in the country. Therefore,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;India as a developing country needs modernised trains rather than the bullet trains to provide comfortness in the travelling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
