<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/18/2013 10:30:49 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which sector, in your opinion, plays the most important role in driving the economic condition of a country? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The world is changing rapidly. In the current world scenario, countries are striving to become the next super power&amp;nbsp;with respect to their growth. This growth is in terms of literacy, economic growth, technology, skills, man-power, science, and so on. The United States of America&amp;nbsp;is considered as the current super power, but the Russians, Asians and the European countries are not far behind. There was a time when the gap was quite big. But now the competiton is neck to neck. Everybody has their own areas in which they excel and grow. Some have the resources, while some are striving to achieve those resources. These countries are inter-connected and rely on each other for resources. Trade is a very important factor in the individual growth of countries. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Technology plays a key role in the economic growth of a country. It is deeply embedded into the system. T&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;he economic condition of a country totally relies on it. Without technology, the country cannot move on in terms of growth. We can see the involvement of technology in every aspect of the country&amp;#39;s growth. The most&amp;nbsp;vital one being nuclear technology. Being a nuclear energy equipped country has its own benefits.&amp;nbsp;Nuclear technology opens a wide array of opportunities. It is useful in&amp;nbsp;energy generation, space exploration, medical science and so on.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The field of medicine has also reaped its benefits from technology.&amp;nbsp;There was a time when complicated surgeries and&amp;nbsp;operations could not be performed in the developing countries. The reason being, the technology was not available. But the scenario has drastically changed now. Apart from the developed countries, the developing ones are more than capable.&amp;nbsp;State of the art machines and use of robotics are now easily available for complicated surgeries. The technology has not only helped needy patients but also the surgeons. Surgeons can&amp;nbsp;complete the&amp;nbsp;surgeries&amp;nbsp;more precisely and accurately with zero complications.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Apart from medicine and nuclear science, technology is&amp;nbsp;essential in many other fields. They are namely, Information Technology, Space Exploration, Life Sciences, and so on. It is&amp;nbsp;one of the&amp;nbsp;strongest pillars&amp;nbsp;on which&amp;nbsp;a country&amp;#39;s economy stands.&amp;nbsp;Leaders across the world put much emphasis on imbibing the latest technology into their system. This not only contributes towards their own growth but to the world economy. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Technology can have its adverse effects also.&amp;nbsp;For example&amp;nbsp;nuclear technology can be used to make nuclear war-heads. We should strive to make sure that such misuse of technology is not done by the negative elements. Technology if used in the right direction and with the right motive can help a country&amp;#39;s economy to rise to new heights. Technology paves the way for a country&amp;#39;s success and betterment of the society. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
