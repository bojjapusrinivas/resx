Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now a days medical care should play an important role&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;because many people are&amp;nbsp;suffering with&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;different diseases and being healthy play a crucial role in day to day life. By maintaining work life balance properly&amp;nbsp; by taking healthy food and weekly health check up&amp;nbsp;is not done in our day-to- day &amp;nbsp;life&amp;nbsp; Now a days, for example swine-flue is a viral disease that can easily spread&amp;nbsp;from one person to&amp;nbsp; another.By this our health condition&amp;nbsp; gone down and many are affected by this disease. Government should take proper precaution by providing free vaccination to the&amp;nbsp;citizens and also free mask to the people, this disease can be easily overcome by educating in primary and secondary schools in rural and urban areas, by this we can overcome this disease. Medical services should provide properly not only by government sector hospitals &amp;nbsp;but also private hospitals should involve in precaution of &amp;nbsp;any diseases.The population of India is go on decreasing because of not providing&amp;nbsp;proper &amp;nbsp;treatment for&amp;nbsp; rural people and they cannot raise a question against private sector based hospital, this will lead to death of many agricultural family`s.By providing proper education and educating &amp;nbsp;a rural women for their medical care and they have to trained to know how to claim their insurance for the amount they paid which make a &amp;nbsp;lot of difference in present life scenario and our country cannot be backward in health sector. Other example is cancer, now a days cancer is a disease that it can attack anyone. For this government should provide affordable price of medicines, so that it can reaches to a common man. The price of medicine is so costly were common man cannot afford&amp;nbsp;and also medical care is not properly arranged.In some case the medicines that are providing to poor citizen in government hospitals are expired and the date of manufacturing is not mentioned clearly, which shows how government acting on one&amp;nbsp; citizen life.my conclusion is it is necessary to commercialize the medical services to every citizen, which is basic necessity of citizens, because every citizen have a right to ask for their medical facilities&amp;nbsp;by electing a leader for the nation and also every citizen should&amp;nbsp;educate illiterates &amp;nbsp;about any diseases, by this we can minimize the spread of disease and we can save one life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
