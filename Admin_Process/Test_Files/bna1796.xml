Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Yes,it is very important for schools to &amp;nbsp;railways.Because everyone should have computer technology for employee to engineering.This because when the schools students should have knowledge in computers &amp;nbsp; and even they need more to learn about computer technology.In railway the need for booking tickets to the people who are going to village.In aeroplane the people wanted to go to other country and they check passport and they will say to them to wait until the depenture will be announce.It is good to them to learn and have knowledege about the copmputer techology.It is increased all over the world about the computer technology.This is to inform that some students do no about computer technology.It &amp;nbsp;may include their computer skills and other technological skill.Even the software employees are working in computer.This is that they have computer skills.It increased day by day in schools,railways and aeroplane also.But it is needed to have computers in all over the world .With this they are doing all the works by using computer.In developing the computer skills they should communicate with the client who in foreign counteries.There should know about to chat,searching for a jobs in computer.Now a days many are using computers for interacting with people in other counteries.This is for the students that they became fast in computer`s.In railway they will give tickets to people to visit &amp;nbsp;any places.So,they should have a good computer technology for school`s,railway`s and aeroplane`s. This is very important for them to work in computer`s.It play a major role in the computer for making many decision making should be good.If there is no computer in all over the world they could not be there.They need computer to do many things like checking accounts,seeing the google,wikipedia and so on.This is to inform everyone that to learn and they get full information about the sensex and subjects for school students and they have to communicate with the other people in the world.They gain knowledge and information about the computer technology.Our lives are going to become more dependent on computer`s as technology advances to the school`s,college`s,railway`s and aeroplane`s.This very big to say that the school students should learn about the subjects and the stories in computer,and they learn all small thing`s like paint,notepad,powerpoint,word,excel and keeping the picture`s in computer.But they do no about the other matter`s in computer`s.It is tremendously that the computer is must for the school,railway and aeroplane.In aeroplane they check the aeroplane`s are landing in same place or not landing.Sometime they disappear`s in some place`s. But in some countries the aeroplane was disappeared.So,they are seeing the computer that the aeroplane`s are landing or not.Thus why,it became fast now a day`s .Computer technology is very fast by school`s,college`s,railway`s and aeroplane`s.The emplyee`s and employer`s are using computer`s at home and in company for the report and project for they work.It is mainly a communication in computer system,they know how to handle the system in computer technology.This is because many employee`s and &amp;nbsp;the people are using computer like sensex,share market and how to develop the systems in computer`s.If the other people does not know about computer we should train them.Thus the people have a decision making in computer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises ,prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the &amp;nbsp;real estate through tax.The government expects these measuers to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs.The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be &amp;nbsp;funded entirely through new borrowing.As a result, given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing.With inflation at 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5-3.5 percent,the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost &amp;nbsp;growth &amp;nbsp;and prevent the South Korea won`s sharp rise against the japanese Yen.In the six months prior to the rate cut,the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea`s export competitiveness vis-a-vis Japan.The BOK`s move is likely to help break this trend. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
