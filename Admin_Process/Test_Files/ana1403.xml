<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;3/26/2014 10:50:13 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under Indian parliamentary democracy, is it possible to ensure balanced regional development? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India is a Democratic country, every citizen in the country knows&amp;nbsp;about this&amp;nbsp;phrase which they have come across&amp;nbsp;during their&amp;nbsp;childhood and they knows the importance of this phrase and democracy in the country, what this democracy has provided for them is also important for every citizen of the country. Elections are also a part of the democracy as&amp;nbsp;freedom to vote&amp;nbsp;is the birth right of every&amp;nbsp;citizen and with this freedom they can elect their&amp;nbsp;leader who leads the country, under him country can be developed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Indian parliament is one of the biggest parliamentary body with 542 members whose value is the development of one constituency, if all the 542 works for the welfare of their constituencies one day India will become global leader&amp;nbsp;among all the nations. This will be possible only if all the parties support the ruling government, in real scenario this&amp;nbsp;is not happening with low majority and&amp;nbsp;problem with supporting parties are exploiting the government to take the decisions which favours one region, caste, creed etc., &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There is slight deviation in the parliament affairs which is mainly due to these political&amp;nbsp;imbalances and the main route cause for this problem&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;due to failure&amp;nbsp;in gaining majority seats by the&amp;nbsp;parties who wants to form their own&amp;nbsp;government. The political&amp;nbsp;uncertainty&amp;nbsp;leads to failure in balancing the regional development as in case of &amp;quot;Telangana Bifurcation&amp;quot; there is a failure of political democracy&amp;nbsp;and this bifurcation is in favour of one region and other regions were opposing this bifurcation. The&amp;nbsp;bill was passed in the parliament due to&amp;nbsp;the influence of one particular party who were giving support the ruling&amp;nbsp;party and they wants to have the bifurcation.&amp;nbsp;This kind of political&amp;nbsp;issues were leads to the formation of states. There are few other regions who wants to be separated from their states and willing to form their&amp;nbsp;own states like Vidarba&amp;nbsp;of Maharastra, Gurkaland of West Bengal.&amp;nbsp;Here&amp;nbsp;in the care of Telangana people of that region thinks that they were not so developed in the present government and they were neglected by the parties for which bifurcation will be&amp;nbsp;a solution for them and present parliamentary system&amp;nbsp;was not in favour to them&amp;nbsp;which made to&amp;nbsp;demand for separate state. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There is no standard game rule for the members of the parliament that they should obey the orders of the government for&amp;nbsp;which they are not representing the ruling government as they are representing a constituency for which people elected them to look after them.&amp;nbsp;The members of the parliament should&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;think once about their constituency and people are looking for their help which is the first duty of them to work for the welfare of the people who has elected them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In case of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand they were separated from their states as they feel that separation cam\n be the only solution to become developed&amp;nbsp;state, this is mainly due to the imbalance created by the leaders who neglected the people and not look after their problems. This is the reason all these separate states were formed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Regional development will happen&amp;nbsp;only if the members of the parliament&amp;nbsp;work for the welfare of their people who believed them and elected them and&amp;nbsp;not for&amp;nbsp;others,&amp;nbsp;encouraging young challenging people and made them&amp;nbsp;to contest in elections can be a&amp;nbsp;added advantage for which they will work for the welfare of people, brainstorming from them will definitely&amp;nbsp;yield good results&amp;nbsp;for country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
