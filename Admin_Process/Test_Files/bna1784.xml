Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;There is a proverb which says "Health is wealth." Health is very important for any person to survive. To maintain health properly, medical care is required. Medical care and medical&amp;nbsp;services differs based on different conditions. One should maintain their health properly and at the same time, educating others about it is also important. Nowadays, people are less concentrating on their own health due to lack of time and so bothering about others health is rarely seen. People, though they are very busy, they have to spend some time for themselves to maintain their health. Hospitals and other medical care services should conduct some awareness programmes to educate people about how important is medical care. It is necessary to commercialize the medical services instead of keeping it for oneself. Because of pollution, work pressure, lack of cleanliness,&amp;nbsp;global warming etc., different types of new diseases are attacking people which are not even heard by ancestors. So to treat all such diseases, scientists are discovering new medicines. With the advancement in technology, most of the diseases are been cured. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;For example, present prevailing disease is swine flu. Many people doesn`t know about it especially people who are uneducated and people who live in slum areas. Governmebt has taken many steps to create awareness among people about it. Along with government, many welfare societies and hospitals are conducting awareness programmes and supplying medicine to prevent swine flub from attacking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;According to some surveys, it is evident that people are spending large amount of their salaries&amp;nbsp;on health care only. Few years ago, private hospitals used good advanced equipment and so many people approach them for treatment but they charge huge amount. People who could not spend much approaches government hospitals where cost is low but treatment is not so good. But these days the scenario has changed. Due to different initiations and polices taken by government, even government hospitals are providing good treatment with advanced technology at lower costs when compared to those of private hospitals. Many hospitals are arranging health camps to educate people about their health conditions. Various medical tests are been conducted in the camps and the patients are been explained about their condition also based on test reports. Such camps creates good awareness among people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;Many medical equipment manufacturing companies from other countries are establishing their plants in India. This increases good medical services for vast population in the country. Every person should have commitment and responsibility about others also. If everyone in the society is healthy, the whole country will be healthy. These days people are becoming busy to earn money and not bothering their health. Though they are earning money, they are not noticing&amp;nbsp;that they are&amp;nbsp;spending all the amount for treatments itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;There is a saying that "Prevention is better than cure." So every person should take responsibility for medical care for oneself and also for others so that diseases can be prevented before they are attacked only.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
