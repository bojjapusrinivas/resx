<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1/21/2015 10:21:01 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you agree with the concept of &amp;ldquo;make in India&amp;rdquo;? Can we have an efficient economy with better lifestyle for an average Indian citizen with this concept? Also elaborate if &amp;ldquo;make in India&amp;rdquo; could be a good initiation to achieve the set target for &amp;ldquo;made in India&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India is a vast country with over 100 crore people as its heartbeat. And sadly we are on the verge ofr being a nation with the highest number of people living in it. Things were demanding change from last four years. But we were not able to see any hope that we will be able to make it. Our Prime Minister Mr, Narendra Modi has taken a initiative in taking his work abilities to transforming India as a World Guru once again. And his main emphasis lies on the Make in India concept. This concept has been in light right from the day Mr. Modi has established himself as `Development Man` of the Gujrat. And he has exploited this image to his full extent in the last year. But the common man began to think about his `Make in India` concept after his legendary speech in The Madison Square Garden in the States. Right from then people have been critically trying to analyse the concept of `Make in India`.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Make in India is an oppurtunity to all those who has been eyeing India as a hub for manufacturing purpose. No doubt India has the pottential to be able to attract worldiwide&amp;nbsp;manufacturers to come and make in India, but today India is insisting&amp;nbsp;the leading manufacturers to make their products in India. But India is not only lacking in funds but it also lacks behind in the infrastructure that other countries provide. We have no match for the world class infrastructure and facilities provided by the China, which is clearly one of the toughest competitor of India. We are today talking about world class companies manufacturing in India but the problem is not in the concept, the problem is in the facilities and infrastructure that we have today. First of all manufacturing requires quick transportation from one place to the other, be it be of raw materials, skilled labour or finished goods. Secondly we require skilled personnels who are capable of working with a zeal to make in India. Thirdly, and most importantly we need to work on the corruption thats spread evenly all across India. Most fo the foreign companies fail to open up business in India because they are not aware about `under the table work` in India. Sadly its the one of the worst realities in India. The fault is of the governing bodies, but why these governing bodies are quite. Because the people don`t want to change themselves. They want others to change for them. So India needs to change and the mentalities of the people need to change. So that we can prosper and prosper to the aspiration of every individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People of India have lots of aspirations from the current government and especially from Mr. Modi. I hope he is able to cope with this burden and liability thats on his shoulders right now. `Make in India` is going to be one of the examplary steps in the growth of India. But first of all we need to mend our ways and we need to mend our society to the world class level. If the change has to began then it has to begin with every individual coming forward and making his contributions to this `Make in India` concept.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
