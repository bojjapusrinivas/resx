This will lead to high employement oppurtunity.It might directly impact on the transportation,In this situation India is need of bullet trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In the present situation of globalwarming,it is better to go with the bullet trains.By introduction the bullet trains with the minimum ticket price,every individual will prefer to travel in the bullet train,by this we can even reduce some part of pollution in India.By the facility of bullet train, the trader can also be benefited by exporting and importing goods i.e.., from manufacturer to the consumer or from manufacturer to the third party.bullet trains is an important advantage for the trader because they can transport the goods to the destination with in less time and less cost i.e.., &lt;span class="bold"&gt;cost advantage and the efficiency in transportation&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;By introducinng the bullet trains not only the customers will benifit, but also the India railways will benifit. coming to the organisation point of view, it also a better advantage for mnc, corporates and global companies because they can reduce ,the cost of incurring on the flights for the employees from one state to other state etc.,.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Now the government has introduced the metrorail system in our country, it was started with the huge fund by the L and T company.It is been started in the year 2010, and L and T company said thatt it will complete its project by the end of 2016, but now also it is been in progress due to the lack of proper planning,funds, and also due to some minor issues.therefore, I feel that there should be good financial resourse and also good stratagy in planning and also every hinderance should be properly solved by the cross functional team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Bullet trains are mostly used in abroad countrys which are developed, introducing the bullet trains in India will also lead the country to develop more not only in financial perspective but also in the technical perspective.at present indian railways are not concerning about the neatness of the platformand and trains, passengers are facing lot of problems with the Indian railways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;conclusion: Indian passengers are very eagerly waiting for the bullet train system with the proper maintainance and cleanliness.It leads to cost management and also time efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
