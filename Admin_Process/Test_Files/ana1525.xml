To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Media is a very important and powerful medium through which information reaches out to the masses.&amp;nbsp;Media has come a long way from what it used to&amp;nbsp;be. In the earlier days, only a certain segment&amp;nbsp;of well-educated individuals watched TV or listened to the radio, however, today the exposure has increased far and beyond. With the advent of social media and the internet, the amount of information available to the common man and the transparency of that information has increased. Television is no longer just &amp;#39;headlines&amp;#39; but also full-fledged debates and discussions, with prominent personalities&amp;nbsp;involved in the economic, social, political and governance structure of&amp;nbsp;our country participating in those discussions. Never before were people of the country facilitated to hear the views of such people directly on their television screen or &amp;#39;follow&amp;#39; them on social media. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This rampant exposure automatically shapes ideas, builds opinions and widens the horizon of thoughts. Media is a direct influence on the sentiments of people as what is&amp;nbsp;broadcasted is almost always assumed to be the truth.&amp;nbsp;When the media shows us a video clip of a politician falling asleep in the parliament session, we have an idea of how seriously parliament sessions are being&amp;nbsp;conducted. Media is not just being used as a broadcasting network but also a network which takes into account the viewers opinions through polls and shows like &amp;quot;The Big Fight&amp;quot; on NDTV. It hence&amp;nbsp;acts as&amp;nbsp;a platform for people to express their opinions as well. The most important reason why media helps develop people&amp;#39;s ideas is because it is more and more transparent. Live footage and popular interviews are broadcasted to the viewer hence enabling the viewer to form his own personal opinion and not form an opinion based on what the newsreader reports. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Media does not just influence the common man but also makes people in higher governance/influential positions more and more careful about their actions. It is ironical to say the least that a newspaper like &amp;#39;Tehelka&amp;#39;, known for uncovering the truth by performing sting operations, was on the facing end of the bullet when the chairperson, Mr. Tarun Tejpal, was exposed by that very same media for his indecent demeanour. Media is a great way&amp;nbsp;of exposing issues that get either side-lined or conveniently hidden under the carpet. It forms a way of expressing different opinions and viewpoints by people from different educational/professional disciples. Especially the print media like newspapers and magazines are a great way to absorb different standpoints and form one of your own. Your standpoint may be significantly contradictory or heavily influenced. Either way the first step of triggering a thought process is what media does on a ground level. It takes you around the globe on different occasions be it war, international sporting events, foreign delegations and a number of other events keeping you informed and associated to the larger world. It improves your knowledge base. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Although media has several pros that make it one of the most powerful weapon of communication, it also has its cons. Misrepresentation by media is the basic con. Like I stated earlier, what media broadcasts is almost always assumed to be accurate and genuine. Given this bearing, media houses should not take a false advantage of this by misrepresenting facts. Any media&amp;#39;s job is only to bring out the facts and to let the judgement be made by the viewers. Bias in reporting, fabrication of news and wrong-mouthing are some of the factors why media can also be a way of directing people to wrong ideas. Media is also to be sensitive to certain issues and not broadcast anything and everything just for the sake of high viewership ratings. An example of this would be the 26/11 attacks where the media was&amp;nbsp;warned not to reveal the positions of the armed forces as this would alert the terrorists. Despite the warning, the media went ahead a reveal information making the task-force bear the brunt of it. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Media, like any other platform has its pros and cons. I would like to agree with the statement that is a huge influence on our ideas. At the same time, it helps generate positive and negative ideas, constructive and destructive ideas. It is a great value addition if it projects news aptly and accurately. But it is also damaging if it conceals, misrepresents or errs. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
