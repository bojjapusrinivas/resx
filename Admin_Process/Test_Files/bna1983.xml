<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/24/2015 5:10:14 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Dependance on computers have increased day by day in every sectors of life. Right from the minute root level areas to the high end scientific technologies the computer has emerged as an inevitable element. This scenario is going to be more visible in the coming days, and the evolution of these machines will create a &amp;nbsp;prominent place in the peoples life`s all over the globe. The statement is true that we will be more dependent to the computers and will be more attached to it in the coming days of near future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The technology of softawres and machines made the life of people more easy and more result oriented. The technology of computers made it possible to bring out less errors in the sectors where they are used and made life more simple. The dependence of human to computers made man more lazier in his physical and mental abilities. As an obeidient servant the computers serve man effectively bringing the mental and physical ability of man in a stagnant position. Men at work feels much relectaunt to work without computers. The ability to calculate and memorize facts and figures by man has been in a diminishing stage, where the man feels difficult to recall even a ten digit phone number which he uses at regular intervals of time. When looking into tha past the activity was done by human brain where he stores upto ten to twenty phone numbers with the corresponding STD codes of different regions. From this we could feel the changes which affected the human brain through the over dependence of computers in his day to day life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we depend upon the computer , the more we loose our mental quotient and even our IQ. Today for each and every aspects we depend upon computers. Earlier we used to refer books to get a matter or to clarify a doubt. But today thw answer in just away one click or at our fingertip. This brings man to access to less knowledge, than referring two to three books. This is a tremondous change occured all over trhe world. Majority of the people who uses computer for hours ended up imn many of the physical ailments such as back pain , pain on neck, loosing of eye sight, migrain and other related problems etc. This brings down the life span of &amp;nbsp;an average man below 50 - 55 ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;When we speak about the areas of computer usage we could not find any space without the access of a computer or computer related gadgets which are used to make the work easier. The people gets moved by the recent technology &amp;nbsp;available to them and get addicted to itself. Even from kids we can feel this tendency over the access of computer. They prefer more to this technologies and thus taking away the essentials which are needed for the real growth of their mental ability and physical formations. Today`s world never finds time to get engaged in physical games and physical meetings. The technology made them to sit in rooms and made them to bring the whole world into their room. This is going to be in its top most level during the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hence by analysing the whole world scenario we could understand that &amp;nbsp;technology has a wide acceptance in our midst. We are taken away by the technology. This is going to harm ourselves and the generations to come. The extreme access and dependence to computer and computer related objects makes man a toy and techoinlogy as his master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013AutoIndustryOutlookfortheUSandEurope&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Auto industry in the US and the Europe falls under a crisis by the decrease in sales of their products during the year 2013. The major reason for the decline in the sales is due to unempoloyment rate which has increased to its peak in United States. In order to over come the situation The US government has extended the average life of cars to 11.3 years &amp;nbsp;from 10.8 which was in 2012. This scenario made banks in Us &amp;nbsp;under great dilemmma, and they offered customers high loan amounts with very less intrest rates to purchase new cars. The over all sales of auto units in the US has declined by 1.1 %, that is 14.5 % sales in the year 2012 by 13.4% sales in the year 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we peep into the Eurpean market the situation is still the similar.The financial crisis in europe and the inflation made much declibne in the auto sales mainly General Motors and Ford who were the market leaders in Europe. Europe has faced &amp;nbsp;an year over year decline over sales in cars and the less demand for cars by the customers. The banks also felt reluctant to give finance and loans for new car purchases. Reuters , the leading news reporters of the world reported that the decline in sales was the steepest compared to previous years where they qouted the decrease to 11.3% &amp;nbsp;which is roughly 9 million units of cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European continent faced the hard face, reports European Automobile Manufactures Association. &amp;nbsp;Most of the auto manufacturing and sales units &amp;nbsp;made a cut off in the number of employees and many of them made their decision to close the plants as they couldnt manage these work force under a great loss. Europe faced its highest rate of unempoloyment over these &amp;nbsp;days and reached 26.5 million by March 2013 by 10.9% percentage compared to 10.3 which was is the year 2012. The major car makers of the globe The Ford plans to shut down its units in UK and Belgium by 2015 and General Motors decides to suspend the production activities at United Kingdom. The financial crisis made other leading auto manufactures like Renault , Fiat, Peugeot, Honda etc to eliminate thousands of jobs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;U.S. Market Recovery &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Strong pent-up demand due to aging vehicles on the U.S. roads along with falling unemployment rate have been the key factors in driving the auto sales in the U.S. Average age of vehicles on U.S. roads increased to 11.3 years in January 2013 from 10.8 years in 2012. Banks were also friendlier as they offered greater access to loans with lower interest rates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% to the five-year high of 14.5 million vehicles in 2012.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Economic Crisis in Europe &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The present Eurozone financial crisis has adversely affected the operations of many global automakers, especially GM and Ford, who have a significant exposure to the market. Car sales in Europe continued to be low owing to weak consumer confidence on the back of a weak economy triggered by the crisis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;According to the European Automobile Manufacturers` Association (ACEA), car sales in Europe reached its lowest level of 12.05 million units in 2012 since 1995, indicating a year-over-year decline of 8.2% due to the sagging demand for cars, as highly indebted banks were reluctant to finance new car purchases for customers. The decline was the steepest in the highly troubled Eurozone, where car sales dipped 11.3% to roughly 9 million units, according to Reuters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Most of the major automakers in Europe are resorting to job cuts and plant closures, as it became no longer feasible for them to undertake full-fledged operations in the continent. Unemployment in the EU reached 26.5 million in Mar 2013, while the unemployment rate increased to 10.9% in the same month from 10.3% in Mar 2012. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the U.S. automakers, Ford plans to shut vehicle and component plants in the U.K. and Belgium in the next two years while General Motors would suspend car production at its Bochum plant in Germany -- which employs 3,100 workers -- in 2016. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the European automakers, Renault plans to retrench 7,500 jobs in France by 2016 while each of Fiat and Peugeot has decided to eliminate 1,500 jobs. Among the Japanese automakers, Honda announced plans to terminate 800 jobs at its South Marston plant near Swindon, southwest England in the second quarter of 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
