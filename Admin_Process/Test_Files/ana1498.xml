Do you think the Bill can help protect people against poverty and insecurity?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Food security bill a boon or a bane for Indian economy-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;From my school days I have been starting my essay by writing India is a developing country . If I look back and see I have completed even Post Graduation and still I am starting an essay with &amp;quot; India is a developing country &amp;quot; . I personally feel that &amp;quot;The food security bill&amp;quot; is a boon for Indian economy but at the same time it is a bane for the Indian economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India is a developing country , there are many people who are starving with hunger for them the government should see they fulfil the basic needs of a human being like food , water and shelter. In my opinion if the government provides these three essentials free of cost then there is no use , even my children starts there essay with- India is a developing country........... and so on. Every one is capable of doing some work or the other, you give them food at the same time expect some thing return from them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Indian Government want to see that every child gets Education free of cost. Though there is a strict law against child labour still parents sends their child to work. To prevent the small tiny tots from going to work , the government has added another initiative that is providing free meals to all pupil who attend school. &amp;nbsp;I have a motivational story to share with -&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I remember my maid sending her children to school only for the reason they get nutritious food at least for one meal. The basic intention of the mother was to provide good food to her child but to every ones surprise&amp;nbsp;the girl turned out to be a bright student through out career. She topped S.S.C with 97 % , through scholar ships&amp;nbsp;she was able to finish her education. The interesting thing I forgot to mention here is - The Girl who was&amp;nbsp;sent to school only to get one nutritious food per day was a&amp;nbsp;top doctor in the city today. She is even running a charitable trust , which provides food&amp;nbsp;and shelter to orphans.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I have already shared an inspirational story of a maids daughter who became a top doctor in a city, well let me tell you another story .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There are many unprivileged people who cannot do&amp;nbsp;any thing themselves for them providing&amp;nbsp;the basics is the responsibility of the government. I really don&amp;#39;t think that is happening because I saw many people who are capable of nothing&amp;nbsp;, begging&amp;nbsp;to live another day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;To start with , yes this&amp;nbsp;is also the story of my neighbourhood . This is the story of our watchman who holds a white card. White card is given to the people who are economically weak. The government provides all the groceries to these&amp;nbsp;white&amp;nbsp;card holders on a very low price. This is because they cannot effort to buy them at market price. As a part of these scheme , rice is provided at a very low price&amp;nbsp;I don&amp;#39;t remember the exact price but some where around&amp;nbsp;5 to 10 rs per kg. My watchman started selling the rice to shop keeper at double the rate which he has purchased. Similarly sugar, wheat , kerosene etc. If every one who gets subsidiary starts selling then think about common middle class people who does not get any subsidiaries,this is how demand and supply curves&amp;nbsp;keep moving putting the need for another word called as &amp;quot;Inflation&amp;quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We as a educated people think that government should give some aid so that every one can fulfil the basics to survive. have you ever thought that this is also a reason for Inflation! Yes in my view it is true. The rich is becoming richer and the poor is becoming poorer. we know that there are so many subsidiaries to help the poor&amp;nbsp;but it is also our duty to check that it is mot misused.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
