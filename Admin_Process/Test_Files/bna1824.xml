Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;medical care which is most important aspect of every living being whether a human, animal or plants. the main element in our life is health if it is fit and good then automatically every thing will be perfect for us. The term commercialization has been used very frequently in every sector, a word of mouth for people. In many hospitals, pharmacy`s this commercial virus has spread all over which made other people a left over for nothing and made mercy killing on them. Each and every individual has health issues but making that commercial is making your life more risky. Life is only one gift which is long lasting but commercialy people are making life a football is their foolishness. Even in rural areas as people over there are not much educated they face these kind of health problems due to lack of awareness about various diseases hence, they approach to big hospitals where doctors and other staff members take an advantage and make medical as commercial purpose for them. This is the way how commercially people are moulded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Life is not a commercial service, where it can make money and go on with the situation how it should be, it is a fate and luck which depends on god who make it. Being a living being, health is a crucial part of our life where it is common for every man, not a poor, not a rich, not a middle class. A common medical care for every one, the only difference is some have good services, where more money is spent more keenly medical care is more deeply diagonised. Sometimes indeed a step which makes us forcefully to go ahead for commercial service to save our life. Medical care should be treated with heart and mind, not with money and wealth once medical care is not good or not treated properly there are more issues which are consistently going on. Nowdays, commercialization evoked out in hospitals where medical services are just being treated only if you can afford to save your life. Earlier there use to be reasonable costs for each and every treatment for all citizens but now it is like diversification among the class of citizens who are rich, poor or middle class. Even the labor class has some schemes where they have free medical check ups, funds for children, but all are vanished because of this commercialization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Its better not to make medical care a commercial aspect, the way how an individual should treat is in the hands of people who can make a commercially free virus by creating awareness through making an self educated for uneducated and having a demanding power to tackle the virus. If the main, medical administrators are not commercial ultimately the whole sector is commercial free.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;By providing good facilities, services and income make every citizen not to be a commercial for these aspects. Those who are commercially influenced for their lives they may face more problems in future.Nowadays, many are neglecting there medical care and focusing on well being if citizens are fit then only they can concentrate for being a well being citizen. But making a medical care to be a commercial, it makes many citizens more trouble rather then making their life tough to live.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;labor class cannot have that well being as compared to other classes, but they required medical care which is more important for their survival, they do not commercialize themselves for medical care to have good life. The better way is what they have is well and good for sustaining in the world to benefit their needs and wants and create a change in their environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In future, there is a commercialization for medical services, if some people are better off without it, they will definitely give a push to this. But as per my view i am more concerned about medical care, which is more important part of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
