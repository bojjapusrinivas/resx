<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;12/27/2013 5:17:27 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this digital age, do you think modern inventions have made our lives simpler, or more complex and dangerous? Discuss with examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naming a span of time as &amp;quot;Digital age&amp;quot; itself indicates the&amp;nbsp;change of the life styles of people and &amp;nbsp;their surrounding environment. That change&amp;nbsp;has been&amp;nbsp;observed from one age to another age. So in my opinion This digital age is not an obstacle or blockage to the globe which remained same throughout different ages from where it has started.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Digital age consist of all the new innovations and creations which are making the human life more comfortable than the previous eras. For example invention of the Telephone brought drastic change in the living environment where people used to send the messages or any kind of information through letters and sending the mediators. Now people carrying mobile phones with them by which they can contact the other people from wherever they are. In India more than 1 billion mobiles have been used by people. A need can make you to do anything and Alexander Grahambel did that.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Another new innovation we can talk about is the Internet. Internet is a place where you can roam around the world by sitting at one place. It is a revolutionary change that we have seen in this digital age. Whatever&amp;nbsp;the information you want , people say &amp;quot; just Google it &amp;quot;. Using of internet will help you in interacting with the people who are at different places around the world. If you can make that&amp;nbsp;at that much easier manner, think what more you can do with the internet. That&amp;#39;s what the different social networking sites are doing right now. People are highly habituated to internet.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If you want to lead your life in a convincing manner you should do some or the other work. This digital&amp;nbsp;age&amp;nbsp; is providing you that chance. If you are sticking to the legacy systems , you can&amp;#39;t get that much of satisfaction. New ideas and innovations lead to the establishment of new industries and companies and you can have more number of jobs that you required. Population&amp;nbsp;has been&amp;nbsp;increasing, necessity of living&amp;nbsp;also has been increasing. If you are still referring to that previous eras you cannot go ahead with the changing world.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;People say the resources have been decreasing and the human values are neglected. As per my opinion what ever the resources are there in the they are for the human usage. It depends on you that how you are utilising them optimally.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In order to be successful in this digital age and not to be degraded one should know the human values and treating the other person in a respected manner. Of course there are people who misuse the innovations and their features. Comparing to previous ages their also people who always tried to do some bad things to people, so that we should control and overcome those problems by using all the knowledge creativity we got from this digital age.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;quot;Life is a race. Try to be the winner,not the participant.&amp;quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
