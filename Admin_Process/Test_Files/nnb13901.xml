Is disinvestment really good for India or is a rethink required? Please take a stand and elaborate.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Before telling about new disinvestment policy, let me explain about the policy. Policy is a type of contract between the insurance company and the client. where the insurance company agree to pay the amount to the &amp;nbsp;client incase of loss, accident, theft etc. In that many types of policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; After elections of 2014, The government has changed and rulling new government in india. It`s very better and changing good. people to see and think about betterment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Recently Indian government announced the new disinvestment policy. It is really good and making betterment in our country. Because rural people can also know about the this policy.recently Indian government announced"Jan dhan yogana pathakam", the main theme of this scheme is to every person in the country maintain their bank accouts,and to gain benifits from bank. that bank should be relates to central govt of india.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;jan dhan yogana pathakam is that many of the people in india they are open their bank accounts and eagierly waiting to gain benifits, i.e.,what the banks are to be provide. mainly for rural people, it is very use. because govt. has providing &amp;nbsp;5 lacks insurance policy per candidate. In case of any issues. like, death of a person. so, &amp;nbsp;providing 5 lack insurance is very huge amount.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; providing 5 lacks is very helpful to poor people. Accoridng to famous survey there 250 billion poor families in india. so, If govt. gives to that much of amount to people, definetly it will helps alot from government of india.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; many families are depends upon a single person in a family. suddenly, if in case they got any accident or any issue, no one can take care of that family. like ralatinves, friends. so, providing this schemes is very useful to them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; And also government should take care about the corruption in all govt. offices. not only in govt. offices, private and govt. and some of corporate companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;corruption starts from low level authorities to high level authorities. many of the government companies are corrupted. so, government of india take care about that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;those who are taking bribe, take care action seviourly upon them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;so, finally i would like to conclude that the govt. disinvestment policy is very helpful to poor people.not only for people but also, many people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
