<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;7/5/2016 11:41:31 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising is way beyond selling product. Or is it waste of resources? Discuss ten advantages and disadvantages of advertising.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Advertising is a medium to reach out to people. Advertising may only be selling products for a company, but for general public it is an association with the company and the brand. For example, Apple in itself is a brand and a status symbol.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The advantages of advertising can be listed as below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) It can be through multiple mediums - Paper, TV, Internet or Radio. Choosing an appropriate medium is important based on the target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) It can generate sales just by a small promotion of the products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)&amp;nbsp;Advertising is a medium which connects the customers to a product. Whenever a new product is launched, the best way to intimate people about is through advertising. In a span of 10-20sec the product`s best features are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Advertising helps in making a brand. Whenever we think of Johnson and Johnson, the first thought that comes to our mind is baby products. For LIC, it is insurance. Even if each single product is not advertised, a main product is advertised and the whole brand gets advertised in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;5) Whenever a new product is launched, the best way to promote it is by advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) Advertising helps in reaching out the product even to the remotest places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) Advertising is a medium through which people connect to a company. For example, in general we are frustrated with low cellular networks or call drops. All the network companies know it, but Airtel has used this to it`s advantage by making it`s services open. Now anybody anywhere can know about the towers and details of Airtel network. This way they are not just promoting their brand, they are in process connecting with the people too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8) Advertising is also used by Government to promote it`s schemes or create awareness. For example, whenever Polio drops are given, they are advertised to inform people about it. The myths about AIDS are busted in a small advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9)&amp;nbsp;With the use of known faces, people usually connect to a product more better. Now a days quirky advertisements are drawing attention and so are which promote equality. For example, Surf Excel Matic promotes sharing of the load of washing clothes. In this way, they connect to its main audience i.e., the well educated and working people, who usually use washing machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;10)&amp;nbsp;It is easy for a foreign brand to enter a new market through advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Disadvantages of Advertising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) People may get mis-led. For example, whenever an insurance product is advertised, it`s terms and conditions cannot be listed in a small advertisement. People may not read and take the insurance and in process get mis-led.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Companies spend a lot on advertisements. Obviously, the burden is passed on to the customers. For example, whenever a celebrity is hired to promote a product, they charge a lot and the burden is passed on to the customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Advertising at times can promote something which is not good for a society as a whole. For example, Fair &amp;amp; Lovely draws on the obsession of Indians with fair skin. On one side there is a need to create awareness about bias to certain misgivings of a society and on other side certain brands promote the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Though paper ads are cheaper compared to TV ad`s, a paper ad can be targetted only to educated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) For start-ups with limited budget it is difficult to advertise. In the process they lose out to other players, though their product quality may be better than them. Sometimes, monopoly gets created. For example, earlier Insurance was equal to LIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) Advertising highlights only the good parts and people get enticed. Some of the products, may be harmful in long run. A person has to be the best judge, rather than going by what the advertisement says. For example, soft drinks do not highlight that they contain Aspartame, which is not good for health. So, people have to make an informed decision, rather than going by what is shown in the adver tisement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) When a celebrity is promoting a product, he/she should be willing to use that product. Most of the times, the celebrities themselves don`t use the product or are not in favour of it. They do it, just for money, which is wrong as people may use a product based on their promotion. For example, recent Madhuri Dixit confession that she doesn`t use Olay Products though she promotes them, she uses products of some other brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8) Too much TV time and News Paper space is used by advertisements, which gets irritating at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9) Some times people end up buying the products which they don`t require, just because they love the advertisement. This is mostly common in children and teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10) Certain compaines compete in a wrong way through advertising. For example, Pepsi, Coco-cola and Thumbs Up are always creating ads which show each other down.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In short advertising has both it`s pros and cons, but in present times we cannot do away without advertisement. Honesty by the companies and informed decision by the genral public is needed to reach out to the goodness of advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Earlier days the houses were small and so were the companies. People used steps to climb, if needed. With changing times and space constraint, even the buildings are getting higher. Here, escalators come into play. They are a form of vertical transporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As not only commercial but even residential buildings are getting higher, escaltor demand is increasing with each passing day. By 2020, it is estimated that escalator revenue would contribute the most to the market revenue. In developed countries such as France, U.S., UK and Canada, smart escalators are being used increasingly. Thus, they would contribute to about 52% of elevator market revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Smart elevators, are elevators which are technologically advanced. They are customised based on the user segments. They have different features based on their usage, as in more space, or more secured, or more control and reliability are some of the factors. For example, in hospitals large elevators are used to carry strechers. In residential buildings, the escaltors are small and efficient. In malls, the elevators are sturdy as they are more prone to damage. In warehouses, the escalators are spacious and comfortable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; There is a rising competition in smart escalator market. One of the competitor is Schindler Corporation, which has installed smart escaltors in the Humana headquarters in Louisville, The Bank of America in Manhattan and the Crescent in Dallas. It has used PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office, Puerto Rico. ThyssenKrupp, has upped it`s competition by using cloud computing to manage systems and sensors of escalators. This helps in better maintenance of the elevators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; One of the cons of using escalators is high consumption of electricity. Innovations to reduce the same are required. Mitsubishi has been working towards it and in 2011 has developed a multi-elevator smart technology that reduces power consumption by atleast 10%. It concentrates on operational efficiency during high usage and uses less energy during low usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Thus, it can be inferred that escalator is the way to go in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
