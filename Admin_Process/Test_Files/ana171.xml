Please take a stand and discuss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than one billion Indians:- I am in favour that , this is a problem and not a sea of opportunities. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Since India is a developing country, and also facing many serious problems like poverty, unemployement, population growth day by day,very low national income as compared to other countries..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;These problems itself are very seroius and are not getting solved, than how can we say more than one billion people(high population) are&amp;nbsp; a sea of opportunites instead of being a problem....&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;large number of people demand large number of services and if these services are not&amp;nbsp;being fulfilled due to its excess demand, we can say&amp;nbsp;that these large number of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;people are creating a problem of&amp;nbsp; high demand and low supply.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We can take Another Example from our daily life:-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;A family having&amp;nbsp;4-5 children&amp;nbsp;is not able to give&amp;nbsp;good education and facilities to thier children&amp;nbsp;instead a family having one child or even&amp;nbsp;two, easily gives good education and anyother facility which is demanded...In short we can say, basic needs are also not fulfilled easily&amp;nbsp;if family members get increased. than how can we say that one billion people are not a problem even when they are effecting nations growth and development..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This growing population is directly effecting our nation&amp;#39;s growth and development. Excess of any thing is always harmfull and dangerous. we are to deal with the problem of illiteracy, unemployment, poverty, and this is not possible or its difficult to deal due to this high population. laarge population require large source of education, than employment opportunites for job, and many other things failing which causes poverty, unemployment,illiteracy, corruption, and many other serious&amp;nbsp;problems which are even out of our reach.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;so, to overcome these problems govt. should take some strict actions.&amp;nbsp; Alone&amp;nbsp;govt. can&amp;#39;t do anythting, so general people also need to help and support govt at their best. This increasing population can not be stoped but can be reduced, for our own sake and for our country&amp;#39;s sake.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;At the end i would only like to say that more than one billion Indains &amp;nbsp;are really a problem for India..., developing India... it&amp;nbsp;might not be&amp;nbsp;if india is.....&amp;nbsp;developed india..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
