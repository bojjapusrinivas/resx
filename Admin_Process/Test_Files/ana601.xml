<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/22/2013 2:26:43 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comment on the short &amp;amp; long term impact of free trade on economic development of developing countries such as India.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, Free trade is now spreading its legs in india these days.It definitely comes with some of the pros and cons in itself.Economic development of the company depends on the varous other factores along with proper implementation of the free trade policy.As in order to achieve the desire results out of the free trade policy any country requires to implement the policy thoroughly.Talking about the impacts that comes with the implementation of the free trade policy a major factor which struck in&amp;nbsp; mind is that of the benifit of the small peasents,merchants (Wholesale and Retail),Impact on agriculture and economic prosperity as a whole.Also,Price discrimination policy,Other market factors Like monopoly ,Oligopoly,Perfect competittions are the factors which can be sought to effect the interest of tehvarious groups including investors.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Basically,Free trade gives you both the convenience and inconvinience.For Example,Availabilty of commodities would be made more easier and effective ,BOP will improve,Communication and trade relations with the other countries will increse,more transparency will be there ,More revenues to the govt. will be the outcome impact of the free trade policies in long run but&amp;nbsp; on the other side of the hedge,with the coming of free trade those who are small merchants,peasents and those with less money to invest will be the sufferer,Also the major long term impact is that the day comes where we only require dollar to run our economy as the rupee will definitely be devaluated that day and we have the less purchasing power.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Also,free trade policy if not resisted to some of the sectors than it may proved fatal for very neccessary sectors like pharma,Education where free trade should be resisted.One major impact of the free trade is called Price Dumping in the economy.For Example, If we are selling the steel in our domestic market @200 Rupees K/G but the same was imported from the country like china @150 Rupees K/G then it wil result in price dumping in domestic economy which ultimately make the indian economy weaken in comparison to&amp;nbsp; economy of the china.Hence, again free trade require to be more cautious as with the good policies of the govt this disvantages and negative impact of the free trade could be reduced.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Also,to be noted that the free trade brings in the foriegninvestment very quickly and is these are not to be bought through the safest sources or you can say allowed sources then it again will create the routing problem of the money and much black money involved is expected to be white which is in actual is not the foreign investment but the domestic currency which is having its outside routing and will majorily weaken the indian economy and that money which is sought to be the foreign investment is eroded in the way.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Kindly, note that these free trades sometimes brings burden on the incidence of tax factors&amp;nbsp;to indian economy and thus ,creating more Balance of Payments burden on&amp;nbsp;indian economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Hence,these are all the factors that are liable to be checked by the FIPB that is Foreign Investment And&amp;nbsp;Promotion Board&amp;nbsp;before allowing the free trade to any of the economy with india.Overall ,the impact wasnot as quite good as it was sought to be because suffferers will be the more sufferes ultimately as there is no upliftment for them with the free trade both in short and long run.However,we can see india will beat the GDP of the china by 2025 if this free trade exist for long.You will see the developed india and high growth rate along with the fear of recession.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Ths in order to have good free trade impact we require to have good free trade policy with other countries where both the countries and citizens would be benifitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
