What do you think are the major steps that can be taken in present circumstances to push growth in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indian economy is generally said to be a dynamic and frequently changing economy which needs&amp;nbsp; much focus on taking relevant measures to get adapted to the uncertain changes. Rising inflation has become a major problem for India hence it has become a reason for several severe problems for the whole of economy effecting&amp;nbsp; the various sectors of economy like agriculture, service,industry and other sectors.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Inflation in India is&amp;nbsp;generally croped up due to increase in dollar rate, changes in the balance of payments, mismanagement of money, increased demand, etc.These&amp;nbsp; effect the growth of economy.There is always a remedy for&amp;nbsp; economic problems if they are studied and analysed in depth. The problem of increasing rates can be reduced by decreasing the demand in the market. The money flow in the the economy must be controlled by Reserve Bank of India by reducing the amount of money pumped into the county. It has to be properly managed by carefully&amp;nbsp; conducting a research on the money needed by the country. The major problem that India faces is lack of entrepreneurs which effect the exports by the country which simoultaneously effects the change in Balance of payments.Hence,Indian government must come up with incresed level of lending to the new businesses. This may reduce the burden of increased exports thereby balancing the imports and exports by the country.Increasing business in a country leads to higher contribution to the income of the country(ie.Gross Domestic Product)&amp;nbsp;which leads to economic growth both technologically and financially.The high political interference must be&amp;nbsp; reduced by alloting the research works to the private organisations which provide the accurate information about the reasons and effects of the inflation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Hence, the economic growth of India can be achieved by effective management of currency, inreasing the exports by encouraging entrepreneurs and new businesses, decreasing demand in the market by reducing mass production, conducting surveys and research programmes on the true financial and economic growth of the country.finally, in my opinion i feel that&amp;nbsp; few of the above mentioned steps or measures can be taken to push the growth of the economy in oder to make India a better manager&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of change and risk.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
