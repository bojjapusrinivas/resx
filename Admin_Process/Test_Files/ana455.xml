What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my view,living in Big Cities offer more benefits when compare to rural areas.In Big cities we have many facilities.But in rural areas there is no proper facilities just like no good education system,there is no proper buildings to live,there is lack of water.So most of the students stay in urban areas to pursue their education.The most significant matter is that there is lot of power reduction in rural areas.So,apparently we can say that Big ciites offer more benefits when compare to rural areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;To minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;First,&amp;nbsp;rural areas must be developed and proper education&amp;nbsp;must give to the rural people&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;.More industries should develop in rural,proper power should be given,good education should be given to the&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;rural people.To reach this accomplishments political leaders should take care of this things.And also people should claim about the problems facing in rural areas.Every individual has the right to raise their problems.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This things can make to minimize the distinct between rural and urban areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
