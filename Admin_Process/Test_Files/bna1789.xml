<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/9/2015 5:26:38 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical care is a basic necessity of citizens, but people are mostly concerned about their well being and not that of the others. Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Certainly it is, now a days&amp;nbsp;human beings are lesser life span compared to the our elder generation because of the food habits and polution in the air and water. so because of this unhealthy environment we have to protect our self from the uncertain events so the medical care is necessary for evary one. In every organization the employer providing medical services to each and every employee so they don`t have a problem coming to illitarate people and formers they doesnot have a much awairness about the medical care so we have to create awairness among the citizens. A decade ago our Honrible Chief minister introduced the RAJEEV AROGYA SREE cards to the each and every citizen those who have the white ration card this will help to the poor people those who belong to below poverty line this scheme gives upto two lakhs medical claim to the people this was a good initiation taken by the government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the recent budjet FDI in insurance sector has invcreased 23 to 49 percent so it will help to increase the more competition betwen the insurance companies so they this lead to the reach the more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;Last decade ago STAYAM COMPUTERS has started the prestegious project called 108 it has got a good responce from the people because of the its for free and with in the location that we are in but due to some financial issues the SATYAM COMPUTERS &amp;nbsp;has closed and the project is in big dialoma. who has to maintain that big project? and who will give that much funding to that project then the government took over that project and now government is running the services of 108 in some places. Thanks to RAMALINGA RAJU for this type of social and innovative service to the poor people after the implementation of this project the people have a common idea about if any accident happend then with in seconds they will get a idea that we have to call 108.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently government has passed a rule that if any person met with an accident its not manditory to file a complaint in the police station and hospitals has to admit that person immediatly without any &amp;nbsp;FIR complaint. we saw in many cases that people are dead due to the late admission in the hospitals so it has decreased now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now a days people are becoming selfish because of evrey one want their life has to safe and if they will not bother about the other peoples lifes they want their family and their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peoples are becoming more lazy because of this technology. laziness is the first step to get into hospital. and lack of the timely food also the effect in our health problems so we have to take care about food first and doing some yoga or exercise will help to increase our life span and decrease our side effects. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government has recently introduced the SWATCH BHARAT campaign is that the clean our self so it will decrease some flues effecting form the dust that is there around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great thing is that recently couple of Political parties has introduced that if any member joined in the party they will give the health insurance upto two lakhs to attract more customers we don`t know weather they will give or not but they are giving identity cards to the members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;so based on the above arguments i can say that medical care is necessary for all the citizens so government has to take some initiation and create awairness among the people and some companies are spending a lot of money on the CSR activities so i will suggest that they adopt some villages and they have to create awainess among the people.&lt;/p&gt;
