Please take a stand and discuss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accouding to me more than one billion Indians are problem, because if the country is small and the population is more then its a problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If u see like US, Aus and UK the population is less the land of opportunities is more and the food, bread and butter is more, stand of living is more, stand of house and main work for employee is less,work opportunities is more, because if need of interst is more the work of employees is less. they will happy to have sufficent of work and the money&amp;nbsp;is there is live in&amp;nbsp;country. compare to the indians we have less opportunities and more of population, for that reason we can not have proper liveing for the&amp;nbsp;humans we&amp;nbsp;are not having the food, land to live, not even good work, poor will became poor and the richer are became more richer.&amp;nbsp;If you make arvies in the people&amp;nbsp;so&amp;nbsp;that will help the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goverment&amp;nbsp;as to take the action&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp; rurel and hurben people &amp;nbsp;has to impleted the thing compare to other countires follow the some important rules it will help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
