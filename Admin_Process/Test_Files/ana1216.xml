<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/4/2014 3:41:10 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With media publishing and telecasting irresponsibly, censorship is the need of the hour. Do you agree or disagree? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here the topic is about the media advertising . As a person I believe that publishing with media may reach to more number of customers at&amp;nbsp;a time but telecasting&amp;nbsp;in media should&amp;nbsp;be done with responsibility &amp;nbsp;.if&amp;nbsp;delivered message is an inappropriate the audience gets negative impact on it&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Example if a company wants to publish their products to their customers the media selection should be correct&amp;nbsp;and they should telecast their product with legal that means they should think about the society and there competitors whatever they are publishing it should not criticise there competitors &amp;nbsp;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;strongly I agree that media publishing and telecasting should be done with responsibly while telecasting in media we should be careful regarding the message and whom we are delivering the message. people will react according to the message delivered to them .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;so,&amp;nbsp; media publishing and telecasting should done with responsible before telecasting they should check it is according to the legal are not and they should check all the documents. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Delivered message should not demotivate any individual it should be precise and&amp;nbsp;clear when we are telecasting something in media it should be attractive and the viewers should able to recollect&amp;nbsp; after&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp;long time also. but now a days it is happening with the irresponsibly example politics&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;when we are publishing and telecasting with media &amp;nbsp;we may get feedback&amp;nbsp; it should be taken as a positive example advertising of smoking it attracts the people but it causes to health issue especially teen age groups &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The selection of medium should be done according to the message for example if advertisement is all about children education if it is publishing in cinema theatre the number of reach of target customers will be less &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Finally, I would like to conclude that publishing and telecasting with media should be done with responsible &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
