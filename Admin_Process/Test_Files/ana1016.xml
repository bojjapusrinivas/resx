<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;12/26/2013 3:33:53 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss various steps that developing countries such as India can take for protecting their environment without slowing the acceleration of development? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Yes we have various steps for improving acceleration of developing countries:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;INDIA is a developing country from decades to now we are saying it is in developing stage means there are so many reasons for slowing the development like social, economical and organizational factors. The main thing that India is facing now is corruption and&amp;nbsp;politics. This impacts many sectors in the Indian economy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Corruption has became a cureless disease in India to eradicate it a great movement has taken over by Anna Hazare now followed by Aravind Krezewal. To make India as a good and developed country the main thing is to eradicate the corruption. This has became like a cureless disease. They along with the followers made a movement to fight against corruption. If the corruption in India has eradicated at least decrease there will be scope for&amp;nbsp;improving the acceleration of&amp;nbsp;development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2. Politics in India has became like a caste and generational based, they are giving to their sons and their grand sons or they are giving to those who belongs to their caste, this impacts country because a leader&amp;nbsp;should make others&amp;nbsp;to follow that&amp;#39;s what in India is&amp;nbsp;happening.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;leader&amp;nbsp;are following their heads in encouraging Corruption, Scam and others kinds this impact the country economic growth. Most of the Indian Politician are having&amp;nbsp;huge amount of money in their accounts, they are taking money from the government sectioned funds for development of different sectors. Scams like 2Gspectrum,&amp;nbsp;Mining and most highest scam in India Coal&amp;nbsp;etc., made&amp;nbsp;Indian&amp;nbsp;economy weaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. So there are less&amp;nbsp;sufficient of funds to&amp;nbsp;the Government and&amp;nbsp;they are increasing the prices of daily needs like petrol, vegetables and gas etc., In the present situation the common man is not able to buy&amp;nbsp;because most of the funds which are blocked by the politicians, businessmen and other high official are not paying taxes for those and not spending much in our country.&amp;nbsp;If the amount was paid correctly the economy&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;country will definitely increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Inflation is&amp;nbsp;one of the main effect for low acceleration in development of India. Most of the prices are increased and cost of living had became high in India compared to&amp;nbsp;1990&amp;#39;s this will be reduced&amp;nbsp;by reducing the scams, payment of taxes, increasing the imports making&amp;nbsp;good&amp;nbsp;investments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. There is a chance of getting more manufacturing industries to India but the cost they incurred in our country&amp;nbsp;is not showing good investment by them.&amp;nbsp;They are not&amp;nbsp;getting expected profits because they are not able to meet their daily operations. So, if we give some scope to them to establish their Industries here there will be a scope for the development. There are industries like software which create good growth in Indian Economy should improve much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. There are many people who are much talented in India but those people are not recognized by the organization. Our country is a bit week in inventing on innovations, if those investment are made and used purposefully there is chance for development in technologically, if increase in technology there is need of manpower. If manpower increases there is scope for decreasing the unemployment rate in India. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The unemployed people in India are more in number most of them are using them&amp;nbsp;manually but not using their talent. If we use them there are much talented people in India who makes creations more than others who are outsourced by India. This unemployment is caused due to lack of knowledge the schools and colleges are providing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. By&amp;nbsp;making corruption free country there is a chance for boosting up the acceleration of development in India. Utilization of funds should more accruable because this helps in getting quality and quantitative work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. The utilization of knowledge, funds, creation and execution may&amp;nbsp;accelerate&amp;nbsp;high&amp;nbsp;in developing the country.&amp;nbsp;Our country should allow FDI&amp;#39;s for the better development of retail sector because it is one of great revenue generating to the government. The government should encourage&amp;nbsp;excellent foreign universities to establish their shops for good quality of education to&amp;nbsp;our people this&amp;nbsp;creates a good competition among Indian and Foreign Universities and quality of education also improves.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;10. The politics in India should be changed because most of them are not working for the country they are working for their own. There should be people like who really wants to develop the country and make the country from developing to developed stage. Our Ex-President had kept a goal that India should be developed by 2020 but by taking care of the above steps make India as a developed country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Finally, I want to conclude that the development of India is in our hands but the current position is like we are taking care&amp;nbsp;of the acceleration of development in India till now it is not showing good growth and not going towards development. So, considering above factors we can say that INDIA can be developed country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
