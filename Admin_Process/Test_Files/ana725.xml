<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;11/26/2013 3:34:03 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is said that &amp;ldquo;Education can Change the World&amp;rdquo;. What according to you are the key contributions of Education in Modern Society? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great western philospoher Hegel, in his flagship work titled &amp;quot;The Philosophy of History&amp;quot; posited that History progresses unidirectionally. He efectively said that there is an underlying logic that history follows while moving from one era to another. He described that the history of all mankind right from the first man to the modern day technocrat is driven by some unkown force. however he didnot proceed to elaborate on the nature of that force. If I were to re-write &amp;quot;The philosophy of history&amp;quot; I would name this force as &amp;quot;Education&amp;quot;. Education is the single largest factor influencing the course of the history of the world. hence i agree strongly with the statement &amp;quot;education can change the world&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While describing my position i would like to put the definition of &amp;quot;education&amp;quot; in the context. By education i donot just refer to the formal education. i would define it in a much broader sense as education being an endeavour attempted by humans to learn something which they donot know about. For example, an uneducated kid knowing and learning that a car moves on wheels by observing its motion is also education. Having laid down the definition of education i shall list down the contribututions made by it to the modern society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the hallmarks of the modern society is that it&amp;#39;s citizens are able to enjoy longer life expectancy. This has been possible because of the advancement of medical science which is able to give tools to humans to fight with deadly diseases. What was once incurable is now preventable/curable thanks to the efforts of several scientists who, armed with education are fighting to get rid of diseases in the modern world. This undoubtedly was a result of education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another of the high points of the modern society is that there are very few catastrophic conflicts happening in the world. i am not for a momenet suggesting that there are absolutely no armed conflicts. however we have not witnessed a global conflict like world war i and ii for a long period now. the major reason for this is a sea change that is happening in the policy making circles around the world. The policy makers of the day are far more educated in multiple disciplines which is allowing to look for alternative solutions apart from waging a war. The unification of Europe is a case in point which would account for a large reason for the prolonged peacetime that the world is going through. The europen having been educated in a variety of disciplines like sociology etc are willing to look for solutions outside the domain of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right from prehistoric man with a club in hand to the modern cyber citizen armed with a laptop one thing has remained a constant. It is the human&amp;#39;s relentless pursuit of luxury. This desire to make life easier to endure is fuelled by progress in technology that lessened that plight of millions. Its needless to say that this progress in technology is driven by education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally education has brought about many social changes in the modern society. be it woman emancipation or the eradication of midless superstitions human society has come a long way in becoming a equitable place for every one. This has been possible because the blinds were removed from the eyes by education. education has created more &amp;quot;rational&amp;quot; beings getting them to question the injustices in the society thus contributing to its betterment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
