Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A country is only as strong as its weakest Economic sector is. That being said it is of prime importance for any country to make sure that&amp;nbsp; growth is not restricted to any one sector or section of its people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If we take the example of Developing Nations like India, Agriculture use to be the backbone of the country&amp;#39;s economy which has been displaced by the Services sector in the past few decades.The Knowledge based industries like the Information technology,BPO and KPO have catapulted India into a position where&amp;nbsp; our people and services are highly sought after.This has led the Government to realize how important it is to have a strong Education system in place to further develop and nurture this Sector.The biggest asset for countries like India are its people its most abundant resource.If we are able to fully tap the potential of this resource it could well be the driver of growth in the Economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;A&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;country which is able to provide Education to its people ensures a Progressive enviornment.The cascading effects of this are Social and Economic empowerment for everyone.It ensures that the benefits of growh reach everyone and there is Equitable growth.An emphasis on a strong Services sector means providing Employment for everyone through Education and Skills.Countries like Japan with limited Natural resources have shown how investing in ones people has made it into&amp;nbsp;one of the Supreme economic powers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India has been able to achieve a lot in the field of Information Technology,Medicine and other cutting edge technology sectors because of its stong emphasis on higher education.However it is time for us to make these opportunities available to each and every&amp;nbsp; citizen to be able to contribute.The irony today is that we may boast of having the Brightest minds in the world but a closer look shows most of these &amp;quot;Geniuses&amp;quot; have moved abroad in search of better opportunities.This is because they do not feel appreciated enough by our own people.It is a major drain on the Economy to lose these precious resources. We are able to provide World Class education and skills to them but not the Enviornment for them to flourish. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;A country can reach its full potential in terms of growth and quality of life only when its citizens are empowered. Education is the path to achieve growth and prosperity in every walk of life. The fate of an economy lies in the hands of its people and the opportunities they are given.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
