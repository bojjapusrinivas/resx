<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:31:09 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthcare is a very important issue in the present scenario.&amp;nbsp;In the past there was no proper equipment and facilities provided which led to increase in the death rate. Now in the present scenario we have a proper facilities and equipment&amp;nbsp;provided, as there is a rapid growth in the technology.&amp;nbsp;Due to&amp;nbsp;a rapid increase in the population there is no proper service rendered to the patients.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Government has to take some major action towards the healthcare issues.&amp;nbsp;Firstly people need to be educated&amp;nbsp;with the issues, the problems&amp;nbsp;that are caused by not having proper information about the disease that they have. The government should create awareness on the diseases that are evolving now a days. so that the people will have an idea about what is the problem that they are facing and they will also get to know what are the precautions that can be taken to prevent the problem if possible, or they can consult the experts who deal with the problems. If the people know about what is happening then they can understand what to do to solve the problem. The awareness can be spread through different mediums like television advertisements, newspaper advertisements where there are large number of viewers watching them.&amp;nbsp;Other then spreading awareness government should increase the number of hospitals and service providers who could attend them immediately depending on the problem that a patient posses. Government should also increase the healthcare awareness centres to help the help in knowing different type of problems arising and the symptoms due to a particular problem. Online services should also be provided along with the temporary solutions which would help them in quick reference. It could also help those people who are not in reach of Hospitals for immediate treatment, they could treat themselves for time being.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Healthcare Institutions&amp;nbsp;should be set up for all the people where they will know what to do and how to treat a small problems that would become big in the future period. There is a huge gap between the demand for the healthcare centres, so increase the number of service rendering institutes that would help a common man to handle small health issues. As there is a increase in the population its difficult to have expertise persons to attend each patient, so increase the number of service providing people. There should be a Healthcare centre for every area which would decrease the travel time for the patient to approach. Government should also increase medical camp facilities&amp;nbsp;in the rural areas, schools, colleges. Healthcare should be introduced as a mandatory subject in every field that increase the awareness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
