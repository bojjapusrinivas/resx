Discuss with examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In todays digital age , I think that invention have made life easy but did more harm and made life complex and dangerous. People are more addicted to the new technologies around them and just don&amp;#39;t care about the people around them who actually care&amp;nbsp;for them .&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp; believe that today&amp;#39;s new invention can be dangerous to our generation and next generation . Let talk about mobile phone or smartphone as our generation know and best friend for us . We can carry it&amp;nbsp;everywhere&amp;nbsp; . But it is most dangerous thing to our life because of the radiations come out of it . It&amp;#39;s not limited to one place but all around us . As we known number of cancer cases are increasing day by day. Government is taking no stand for the welfare of the people .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Technology is improving day by day . Making our life easy to sum extend but more complex .It is mainly influencing the life style of the people and its changing the way of thinking&amp;nbsp;people use to thing in old age . For example cycle was invented to make the life easy but now no one is using cycle .Life become complex and today there is no space for cycle in the road because of new innovation is going around the world . New&amp;nbsp;innovation are coming in and &amp;nbsp;old thing is going out. But&amp;nbsp;these thing is impacting&amp;nbsp; our lives and people around us.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;New innovation must be done in order to make the task easy . But not totally depend on that and become lazy , careless , leaving all the work on technology .Most important&amp;nbsp;fact is&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;REAL INDIA &amp;quot; depend&amp;nbsp;on agriculture and there were was new innovation in agriculture was&amp;nbsp;cultivation seed it was known &amp;quot;BIO SEEDS&amp;quot; . It was a miracle product for farmer and they start cultivating and started the using&amp;nbsp; the &amp;quot;BIO SEEDS&amp;quot; and the result was they got a income of 3 year cultivation in one year and the demand for &amp;quot;BIO SEEDS &amp;quot; increased and people started using it without knowing the PROS AND CONS and impact of the seeds in our soil and land.&amp;nbsp; when people not able to get the bio seeds and just started using the old seed and the results was no cultivation because the &amp;quot;BIO SEEDS &amp;quot; impacted badly on the quality of soli and the moisture and various important quality need for the cultivation of any commodities . It was really a disaster year for the farmers and the fact it was because of less knowledge and education .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
