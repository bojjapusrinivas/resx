<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/18/2013 10:38:00 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which sector, in your opinion, plays the most important role in driving the economic condition of a country? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economy, as we know it, is a standalone term that is fuelled by multiple sources. Airline industry, railways and&amp;nbsp;entertainment industry are some of the frontrunners that contribute maximum to the country&amp;#39;s economy.&amp;nbsp;However, when&amp;nbsp;it comes to driving the economy forward in a more non-sale driven manner, nothing surprasses the food sector. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Lets compare the food sector to a business&amp;nbsp;enteprise that has come up with a new product. Now, having completed the product lifecyle development, what is the focus of the company&amp;#39;s strategies before they launch the product in the market? Target customers - that&amp;#39;s where every professional with a sound business acumen will be laser-focussed at. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Coming back to the&amp;nbsp;sectors; take, for instance, the railway sector. In any nation, a billion&amp;nbsp;people travel by trains from one state to another, or between different locations in a single city. The profits earned are&amp;nbsp;unprecedented. But, are there alternatives to trains? A whole lot of them. You have flights for long journeys and buses for shorter ones.&amp;nbsp;Besides, going on&amp;nbsp;the road-trips has always sounded tempting, so you don&amp;#39;t have a dearth of individuals and families fuelling up their cars and setting off for a long road ahead. Same is the scenario with other sectors, as each one of them&amp;nbsp;has an&amp;nbsp;alternative that&amp;nbsp;competes against it. Yes, there aren&amp;#39;t many alternatives in entertainment industry, but there is a small percentage of population employed there.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The food sector does not depend on selling (in the true sense of the word). The &amp;#39;target customers&amp;#39; of this industry are people from all strata, irrespective of which income group they belong to. Food sector launches products which everyone wants. You don&amp;#39;t have to lure customers&amp;nbsp;with outrageous offers and schemes. Food is not a luxury which only a selected people would buy. Rather, it is a necessity. And yes, it has no alternative.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
