<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;12/26/2013 3:34:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss various steps that developing countries such as India can take for protecting their environment without slowing the acceleration of development? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steps that the developing countries can take for protecting their environment is by using of technology. Its a noticeable change we can see regarding the population growth, technological advancements, ability to acquire and succeed. With the help of technology we are able to move forward and similarly protect the environment. For example, we can consider Indian Tobacco Company(ITC) producing the notebooks &amp;quot;CLASSMATES&amp;quot;. This company cut downs a large number of trees every year to produce the world class books but also protects the environment by planting the number of trees they have cut down. The product which they produce is environmental friendly and are recycled.&amp;nbsp;Hence similarly the government of India and other such developing countries should take initiative and make sure that all the companies should follow certain environmental measures in their respective organizations and make it as an mandatory act for the organizations. The government should take responsibility in educating the people regarding the effects and causes if we don&amp;#39;t protect the environment. Similarly, by saving the environment and producing the environmental friendly products help the nation grow faster in an effective and efficient manner.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Due to Globalization, we are able to succeed and reach our goals with the help of internet and technological advancements which reduced very high mechanization. The government should also encourage the organizations which are following the various measures to protect the environment and similarly show the growth of their organizations as a trade-off. The government can encourage such organizations by giving them awards like &amp;quot;the best environment protected organizations&amp;quot;. In this fast moving world, revenue is given the utmost importance and hence we can see many mergers and acquisitions taking place in order to sustain themselves in the available market and become a part of major players in their country. When we are able to manage such large organizations, employees with their skills and competencies , competitors , to sustain the organization it should be a part of their organization ethics and SOP(Standard Operating Procedures) to protect the environment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Organizations should follow various environmental measures such as,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Producing and use of environmental products&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Continuous Tech-Refresh in the organizations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Maintaining six sigma standards(Quality-based)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;selecting appropriate Vendor and evaluating them in terms of environmental aspects they follow in their organization.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Following Lean Management and Kaizen costing in order to reduce the wastage and produce the best for the customers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Training should be provided in terms of protecting the environment and brings an add-on to the organizations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The government should allow the mergers and acquisitions only if they are following the environmental measures in their organizations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Maintaining separate development team for environmental measures in order to produce effective results and continuously analyse according to the outputs received.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;By following such certain measures in the organizations and producing the best products brings in more revenue by the trust developed within customers and become loyal towards their organization. Maintaining of TQM( Total Quality Management) and EOQ(Economic Ordered Quantity) such as maintain their inventory issues can be a part in protecting the environment as it reduces the wastage and helps in the frequent replenishment in the organizations.&amp;nbsp;Doing and following Corporate Social&amp;nbsp;Responsibility is the basic requirement for protecting the environment. We can here also consider PANASONIC organization which produces the environmental friendly products which advertises as a benefit to the customer by reducing their electricity bill (power consumption) and effective usage of products. This advertisement brings in revenue by creating loyal customers towards their organization. The environmental measures can be followed in terms of packaging the product. Even the people should follow few principle such as avoiding of plastic bags and avoiding the use of animal skinned products and etc. We can see the countries like China and Korea producing effective results and growing at an accelerated speed by maintaining environmental measures and continuous upgradation of technology. To substantiate, we can&amp;nbsp;take into view the organizations like Toyota, Samsung, Suzuki &amp;nbsp;and etc. Hence the organizations should be careful during vendor selection, mergers and acquisition which helps in growth of their organization and at the same time by following the environmental measures. The supply chain and logistics play an important role in terms of environmental aspects like implementation of cross docking, number of fleets, packaging, continuous forecasting and frequent replenishments and etc. Hence, the government and the organizations should follow certain ethics and follow few mandatory acts in order to protect the environment and helps in both the growth of the nation and organization in a balanced manner. The government should enforce many environmental protecting acts and initiatives in order to develop the country in an more efficient and effective manner. This is Hemasree signing off.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
