<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/27/2015 5:09:25 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;As our tecnology is greately developed by using computers.computer is a eletronic device which consists of input and output data it process input and gives output.In past people need lot of space for computer but in today it does not require huge space even we can use laptops which doesnot require much space . Its very important to use computer and to have knowledge on computer in todays world.without computer we cant imagine our world.In past there is no much use of computer its has changed our tecnology it is very useful in ITsector,BPO`S without it our country will be under developed we cannot develope software sector..In today`s era even a school going childern need system. By usinging computer tecnology we can easily book air,railway etc easily.people in todays era if they want any information they are depended on internet they not think of the data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In todays era in each and every field computer is necessary without computer we cannot develope the sector.so to develope our country we hava to depend on computer and tecnology.In each and every field computer is necessary or else we cannot develope our country. Even forign companies to invest in India we should have increased tecnology so that we can get more investments globally.in past there no huge investments in India but today due to increased tecnology investor are investing in our country.Many forign companies are started in our country due to increased tecnology which reduced poverty, unemployementetc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In todays era each and every individual are depended on computer its somehow good to develope technology but to much depend on computer is not so good because young individuals are becoming lazy to think and it may spoil health of individual.According to my view depended on computer to develope tecnology is good but in society using computer spoiling teenaegers, children if any work is assign in school or colleges they simply depend on computer they not even try to think of data.In past before introduction of computer individual thinking capacity will be more when compared to todays individual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013AutoIndustryOutlookforAsia&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Asian countries especially china world largest population and India second largest population countries people in these countries are passion to buy small cars.so, there is a growth in auto industry over five to seven years as these countries are rapidly growing and demand for small cars is rising.The total sales anticipates on small cars is 55% on 2020 in present it is 48%and one third of sales are expected from Asia.In 2012 ,Ford announced plans to export the engines from India and shipping them for the first time to Europe.currently , the automakers exports 40% of India made engine and 25% India made cars to 35 countries and company expects to manufacture 450,000 cars and 600,000 engines in India by 2015.It has already pumped in $2 billion to bulit manufacturing facilities in &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; India. in april 2015 general motors revealed plans to built four new plants in China in order to boost &amp;nbsp;annual producation capacity of 5 million vehclies and triple its exports from chinese plants by 2015.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 - Auto Industry Outlook for Asia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Asia Promises High Growth &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The Asian countries, especially China and India, are expected to account for 40% of growth in the auto industry over the next five to seven years being the rapidly growing economies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Ford anticipates global sales to expand by 50% to 8 million vehicles by 2015 given the potential growth in Asia, mainly China and India; and rising demand for small cars. The automaker anticipates small cars to account for 55% of the total sales by 2020 compared with 48% presently. One third of the small car sales are expected to come from Asia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In late 2012, Ford announced plans to boost exports of its engine production from India by shipping them for the first time to Europe. Currently, the automaker exports 40% of its Indian-made engines and 25% of its Indian-made cars to 35 countries. The company expects to manufacture 450,000 cars and 600,000 engines in India by 2015. It already pumped in $2 billion to build manufacturing facilities in India. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In April this year, General Motors revealed plans to build four new plants in China in order to boost annual production capacity to 5 million vehicles and triple its exports from Chinese plants by 2015. GM and its joint venture partners in China plan to invest $11 billion in the country by 2016 as part of their major expansion program. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In 2009, China overtook the U.S. as the biggest auto market in the world by sales volumes when the Beijing government introduced a stimulus package, including tax incentives for small cars. China accounted for a third of light vehicle sales growth in the last five years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However, the incentives were scrapped in 2011 and the Beijing government imposed quotas on new car registrations in order to control the traffic congestions. In 2012, sales in China grew 4.3% to 19.3 million units, which is lower than the 8% growth projected by China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) as well as the double-digit growth in 2009 and 2010. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the country are expected to improve if the government renews some of its policy incentives that helped the country overtake the U.S. as the biggest auto market. According to the Chinese government, total vehicle sales in China are expected to rise 7.8% to 20.8 million vehicles in 2013 from 19.3 million last year, led by strong demand for passenger vehicles and economic recovery. The CAAM believes SUVs will remain the fastest-growing segment in the year while commercial vehicles will record a moderate gain in sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
