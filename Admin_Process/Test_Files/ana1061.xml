The impact of recession on Indian Economy was subdued as the domestic fundamentals were strong and provided the required infrastructural support.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspite of the slow growth of the economy at the start of the decade, macroeconomic fundamentals that largely control the growth will provide the necessary momentum in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key factors that will escalate economic growth by 2020:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian economy is expected to cross the US $5 trillion barrier by FY 2020. This growth will result due to the contribution of the following sectors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Growth of the services sector&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Increase in investment activity- 40.7% of GDP by FY20, which is a sharp increase from the 36.6% in FY10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Infrastructural development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Incremental domestic investment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving Factors for the economy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An overall inclusive growth will result from the investments in social and physical infrastructure. Investment in electricity sector will account for 3.6% GDP by FY20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrastructural investment will result due to employment generation, improved operational efficiencies, decline in business costs and improved standards of living. It will reach upto 11.5% of GDP by FY20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governmental policy to support healthcare growth will also auger the healthcare expenditure to 2.2% of GDP by FY20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private sector will boast a contribution of 48% to the GDP in FY20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agriculture would be one of the sector to lead the economic growth frontiers as it is expected to grow around 3.2% of GDP by FY20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don&amp;#39;t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="4"&gt;India Economic Outlook&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;India remained remarkably resilient from the global economic turmoil in 2008 owing to its strong domestic fundamentals and had been one of the fastest economies to recover from the crisis. Currently, the growth momentum of the Indian economy has again been impacted. This time around besides the prevailing crisis in some of the developed economies, emergence of certain domestic issues had played a major role in restraining India&amp;rsquo;s growth momentum. However, we believe that India&amp;rsquo;s long term growth prospects will remain buoyant driven by its underlying strong macroeconomic fundamentals. We believe that emphasis on boosting investment activity and setting up of a favorable policy environment will act as a catalyst to unravel the growth potential of the Indian economy during the current decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;The highlights of the analysis have been provided below &amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s macro-economic outlook 2020:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="4"&gt;India is expected to be more than US$ 5 trillion (current market price) economy by FY20. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;The size of the Indian economy will be comparable to the Japanese economy (in terms of GDP in US$) as of 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;We expect the current phase of subdued growth to continue till FY15 before the economy moves into a high growth phase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s economic growth during the current decade is expected to be driven by the buoyancy in the services sector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;Investment activity is expected to accelerate going ahead, which will help the Indian economy achieve a higher growth rate. Share of investment to GDP will increase to stand at 40.7% of GDP during FY20 from 36.6% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;Infrastructure will be both a cause and a consequence of economic growth during the current decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;Strong growth in domestic savings will support domestic investment. The savings rate is expected to surge to 39.5% during FY20 from 33.8% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="4"&gt;Under consumption, share of discretionary spending is expected to rise significantly to 70% of private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) as compared to 60.0% (P) in FY11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Economic growth drivers:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="4"&gt;Substantial investments in social and physical infrastructure will be the key growth drivers that will enable the economy to achieve &amp;lsquo;inclusive growth&amp;rsquo; over the current decade&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="4"&gt;Infrastructure investment in the electricity sector is expected to account for 3.8% of GDP by FY20&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;Investment in physical infrastructure is expected to lead to employment generation, increased production efficiency, reduction in cost of doing business and improved standard of living which is expected to drive infrastructure investment (as measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation) to 11.5% of GDP by FY20 from around 6.0% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;Increased government focus towards improving overall healthcare facilities is expected to enhance total government expenditure on healthcare to 2.2% of GDP in FY20, as against 1.3% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;The share of the private sector in infrastructure financing is expected to increase from 39.4% in FY12 (P) to 48.0% in FY20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large"&gt;Investment in the agriculture sector is expected to grow to around 3.2% of GDP by FY20 as against 2.6% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
