Do you agree or disagree? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I agree that the censorship is the need of the publishing and telecasting the news in media, mainly the film industry plays a major role, because&amp;nbsp; now-a-days there are many scenes all are ages should not seen. To avoid that scenes the censor board is very important in film industry. Now-a-days the directors are directed the movies only to attract youth. Positives messages are not provided to the public. Directors concentrated on the ages because, that people are attracted to the movies. So, the censorship is very important in film industry. Censor board has a right to stop the film because, the unseen scenes. Directors are creating a movie to attract the people and public, so they are putting the scenes in the movies, and publishing and telecasting. For that purpose the censor is playing a vital role and removing the unimportant scenes in the movie. So, public are also attracting the movie. In india, the media is playing a very crucial role because, they are giving a good messages and as well as the bad messages to the public. So, that the youth are following, either the good or bad messages to saw the films. For that purpose censor board is important for removing the scenes whoch are harmful to the public.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The main reasons for creating the censor boards in film industry is to avoid and removing the unseen and to protect the youth and public. Once the direction is completed the industry committee must get approval to the censor board for releasing the movie. Censor board is giving permission to release the movie.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Then we, come to the other reasons business people are giving advertisement and adds in media, for the promoting and marketing their products in market. For that purpose also, the censor board has to give the approval for publishing and telecasting.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;For example, Honda company are manufacturing a new product to their customers, for promoting the sales the company are giving add and telecasting in media, for that company also must get approval to the censor board for telecasting the video.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If we come to business media cannot deliver all things about the company or product even in such cases after delivering the message , by that time the company are providing the information for all their company.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Almost all the companies competitors, competitors may create some problems to the companies by using media, is such cases also companies can save their fame by censoring the news immediately, when they went. In some cases, the strategies of business, were also leaked. Through censorship, companies strategies can be kept secret.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Now-a-days, media that companies mostly using the social media network for their business operations,&amp;nbsp; like gmail, &amp;nbsp;face book , and twitter etc. Companies try to promote themselves and make corrections with other company.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Conclusion: Now-a-days the censorship is needed to hour along with the publishing and telecasting and to increase and to develops the companies fame and reputation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
