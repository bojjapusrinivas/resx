What do you think are the major steps that can be taken in present circumstances to push growth in the country?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Due to rising inflation there are many problems faced by individuals in our country.Indian economy plays a major role in deciding the policies,rules and regulations that are to be&amp;nbsp;followed by individuals.So in order to control inflation many new policies are to be incorporated to overcome the problems faced by individuals due to inflation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Theses days the major problem that is faced by our Indian Economy is decreasing value of rupee this can be due to several reasons and one main reason can be due to increasing imports and decreasing exports.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;So care should be taken in utilising the available resources properly and producing the products instead of importing them from foreign countries.This inturn helps in&amp;nbsp;improving the GDP of the country.The most important aspect that&amp;nbsp;can be&amp;nbsp;concentrated&amp;nbsp;is giving highest prority to agriculture industry.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Political parties should concentrate&amp;nbsp;more in order to reduce poverty by providing special schemes and policies.Well educated people prefer working in&amp;nbsp;foreign countries and try to gain more benefits and use their talent in building foreign country&amp;#39;s economy.This practise should be changed and each individual should feel responsible and work in their&amp;nbsp;own country and help in&amp;nbsp;increasing their country&amp;#39;s economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Technology also plays a crucial&amp;nbsp;role because innovation of new technologies may reduce the work of individuals&amp;nbsp;to a greater extent and&amp;nbsp;helps to accomplish the task in best and effective way.These days political parties are working for their own benefits and people who are choosing their leaders should be very careful in electing their leaders.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;A&amp;nbsp;detailed survey should be made and analysed to know where and in which industry the country is facing many problems and care should be taken&amp;nbsp;to reduce the problems to get more profits through which our Indian Economy can expect revival despite rising inflation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
