<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:32:32 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Healthcare - it is the word which can sound alarms in the minds of general people. The moment a common man thinks about his healthcare ,the first thing which comes to his mind is the amount of money he has to bear to maintain&amp;nbsp;his good health. Health is wealth as we all know because if the man is not healthy what is the use of having a lot of wealth&amp;nbsp;which he can&amp;#39;t enjoy. In India, there is lot of poverty and most of the middle class and lower income class population cannot affort quality healthcare for themselves and their children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;font size="2"&gt;The healthcare facilities have seen a rapid growth in India in recent years. Also the awareness of people about various health insurance plans and their investments to be prepared for unforseen health problems have been of much help. But the quality of healthcare provided to people varies across different healthcare service providers. For few providers, it is solely a business which can generate high revenue .They charge high amount of money to provide a treatment even for small injuries or ailments. There are others who provide high quality of treatment and charge as per the service provided to the patients.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Also the investments have increased in healthcare sectors from various corporates . The corporates encourage their employees to apply for medical insurance and avail those benefits in case of emergencies. It helps to improve the bond between the organization and its employees and helps them to work in a positive manner. The Goverment of India has also introduced many heath benefit schemes which can be availed by the population which cannot afford quality healthcare facilities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Though the Government offers many such facilities , due to&amp;nbsp;lack of&amp;nbsp;awareness many people cannot avail such facilities. The facilities such as Central Goverment Health Scheme and Employee State Insurance etc. are&amp;nbsp; widely used by the working classes for the benefit of their family members. Such schemes also provide free regular health check-up and also provide medicines on regular basis.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There are many healthcare providers who indulge in many malpractices. They take advantage of innocence of people and charge high bills which are ultimately borne by the government . The government should keep a strict watch on such organizations which manipulate the schemes for their own benefit . There are many cases where due to ill effects of pollution caused by various factories situated near villages , lot of ailments are caused and the population residing nearby suffer the most. The government should regularly monitor such factories and make them comply with the norms or remove them completly. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; Also, the role of middlemen who fill their pockets from the money which is issued for healthcare of needy should be kept under strict watch. There are few people who indulge in unethical practices and obtain the services which they could afford by themselves but prefer to use them for free as it is borne by the government. The government should take timely action to curb such unethical acts and malpractices. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; The government may think they have done enough to reduce the gap between the healthcare supply and demand but their task is never complete untill the right healthcare service is provided to the needy population who cannot afford it. Introducing the health schemes is only a beginning but right implementation of such schemes should be the ultimate goal for the government . If it happens in near future , then we can hope for a healthy and happy India for coming generations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
