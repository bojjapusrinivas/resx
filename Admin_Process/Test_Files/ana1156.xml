What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, in India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. The main reason why India is lagging in health services is because of its literacy rate. More than half of the India&amp;#39;s population are illiterates,they rush to hospitals only at the time of emergency. They are not aware of serious health issues and not aware of dreadful viruses. Government of India should start campaigning with the help of volunteers and other agents to spread awareness about how to be healthy and how important it is to be healthy. Recently government has started taking up some advertising activities through television as its media regarding the importance of using toilets and family planning activities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Apart from this government should provide special&amp;nbsp;scheme&amp;#39;s for poor and middle class sectors to improve people&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;health&amp;nbsp;conscious state. Government should start educating the children first in schools and then the students in colleges. Main reason for facing problems in healthcare services in India is due to its growing population. Birth and death has lost its value in India. Government should start educating the backward classes about the serious problems they face in future where&amp;nbsp;they have small income and big families. Next what the government can do is to help the poor sectors of the society by providing them selfless doctors rather than commercial doctors. Doctors in government hospitals have limited income where they may not like to concentrate on patients with interest. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Next moving on to middle class people in India are aware about the health problems and its importance&amp;nbsp; they may not have sufficient amount to get treatment ,the government here can help proving Insurance services . In India the supply of healthcare is there and always will be there for rich. The gap between supply and demand is not&amp;nbsp; higher in upper class. The gap is a bit far in middle class where people have income but not sufficient to pay shocking hospital bills. The gap is tremendous in poor and backward classes where there the people are not been educated about the importance of health and in some cases they cant even know the reason behind viral fever ,they assume that its because of some black magic and other superstitions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We often see people who have cancer and other dreadful diseases come on news channels and literally ask people to help them. Mankind and humanity grounds are also lost these days, what&amp;#39;s surprising here is when people come on&amp;nbsp;news channels&amp;nbsp;to ask help not even our film stars whom we worship ,our Neeta&amp;#39;s whom we vote will not lend their helping hand. Government should notice such repeated scenes and take care of such patients. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Many organisations&amp;nbsp;such as smile foundations, Vivekananda hospital&amp;nbsp;are established and socialites are doing there job like a religion but the ultimate move should come from the Government, it has the capacity to make or break the nation, so why cant provide basic help in health cares. Government should provide health services&amp;nbsp;and develop hospitals with fair doctors for middle and poor classes. Paying insurances and providing free medical facilities&amp;nbsp;for poor&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp; unemployed and senior citizens is what government should concentrate on. More and more knowledge must be provided in schools and colleges. Many backward villages must be developed. Superstitions should be left, should control population. All the above mentioned activities can help people to understand and fight for themselves during the time of crisis. &amp;quot;SELF HELP IS THE BEST HELP.&amp;quot; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I conclude by saying that accidents and other&amp;nbsp; natural factors are beyond our control but, to help and promote the people in India about the value of education, health and how important it is to be healthy&amp;nbsp;is the ultimate responsibility of our Government which can be done through huge campaigns, mass speeches, advertisements, lending financial help for poor and needy at least at the time of crisis is called as mankind.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
