As India is a developing country &amp;amp; It was always having Pressure from countries like China &amp;amp; Pakistan.Army of India is been given importance by Governement of India and they are the one who protects the country from any kind of attacks that are planned by any rival countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In the year 1999, when Kargil war took place, Our country Prime minister Mr.Atal Bihari Vajapaye, made the country army to fight against pakistan &amp;amp; finally india won the War. In early 60`s &amp;amp; 70`s when there was war, our country prime minsters played a crucial and overcome with difficult situations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;This problem can be solved with open discussion &amp;amp; exchanging of views, what are the expectations of the other side. should be known. Many Governments are changing, but The issue of India &amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Pakistan is not getting solved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Natural conditions cannot be controlled by man, but man made conditions&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;can be controlled &amp;nbsp;, which is good for the society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Good is not bad, bad is not good.The prevalling situations of our country can be solved only by mutally cooperation.Policies are framed, but when it comes to implementation of these policies, we find only restricitons, rules &amp;amp; pressure from politicans to common man, how can there will be safety of common man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The armed forces should be on high alert and if they are not going alert then securties of people will be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is a country which has unique Natural resources, these is the major reason of the attacks, these attacks can be controlled , but &amp;nbsp;this is are regular problems which has to be faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural Disaster &amp;amp; man made attacks will be always assocaites with our country. India is pool of Intellectuals and These type of attacks wil be answered by armed forces with latest technolgy in weapons, software that can be used in war field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any climatical conditions many prevail in our country ,possiblities will be peace ful continuing with daily affairs &amp;amp; countries development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country`s success depends at the safety of the man. So, Policies should be implemented strictly , then only change will come or else . it will be always in high alert.&lt;/p&gt;
