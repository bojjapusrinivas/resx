List out and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of work from home had evolved with the advancement in technology and awarness of computer knowledge to every one.Previously the work had to be done being present at the office or repective organization.But the employees now a days are given flexibility of even working from their homes,the organization provides them with respective resources and they can achieve their targets without actually being at the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main advantage of work from home is that in few cases where in the employees cannot be present in the organization due to personal reasons or health factors they can show their skill and knowledge by working from home.The organizations anyhow keep updating them through telephonic conversations about the work to be performed. when the employee is given comfort and convinient environment to work he/she can deliver more to it.It can also be considered as a motivated factor by providing such flexibilities to the employees.The same work cannot be delieverd to the same extent by employee if he/she will be forced to be available at the organization and work.Now a days all the organizations are availing such oppurtunities to employees to work from home.Will reduce the stress on employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DisAdvantage:Working environment is not created and the external factors may affect the work done by the employees.Face to Face interaction is not possible with the leaders or peers.Proper and ontime evaluation cannot be given to the employees.Genuity of the work is the major constraint in work from home.The fear of leadership doesnot exist among the employees working from home.Time taken to wind up the work will be more because working from home deviates the employees from actually working seriously.Cocentration levels of the individual will be tampered with the home environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to significant increase in industrial output and consumer sentiment the economic activity was increased. After declinig continously for past two times the industrial production growth has turned positive in april with 1.7% year over year.Similarly purchasing managers index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years.we can say that foreign expansion was higher.The bank of koraes composite sentiment states that its composite consumer sentiment index went upto 104 in may from 102 in april which is one year high in march.The cosumption growth is likely to benefit from low infaltion and low unemployment.Countries fiscal stimulus plan and monetary policy easing will benefit both cosumption and investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy combinely improve to support the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In may south korea parliment ratified a $4.8 million stimulus plan to help small and mdium enterprises,prop up worker incomes,and boost cooperative investments and real estate sectors with tax incentives.The goverment assumes that this will help to increase GDP &amp;nbsp;by 0.3% and create employment of 40,000 jobs in the country.The stimulus package includes $15.4 billion supplementary budget will be fund by new borrowing.This will increase the fiscal deficit to 1.8% of gdp in 2013 and a previous target of 0.3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push has been complemented by monetary policy easing.To prevent the countrys won`s sharp rise against japanese yen the bank of korea eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in may where was at 14 year low in may with target rate of 2.5-3.5 %.beacuse of which yen had fallen more than 20% against won in six months prior to the rate cut.This move of bok is likely to break the trend of south koreas &amp;nbsp;export competitiveness and also japans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
