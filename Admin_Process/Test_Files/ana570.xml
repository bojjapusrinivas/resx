<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/18/2013 11:22:22 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which sector, in your opinion, plays the most important role in driving the economic condition of a country? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, any nation is driven forward by the contribution of all the sectors existing in the economy. It is not the role of any one sector that drives the entire nation forward. Please allow me to explain with an example:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Every nation has its own natural resources (minerals, metals, water, flora, fauna etc.) and human resources. What a nation will be good at producing depends&amp;nbsp;to a great extent&amp;nbsp;upon the gifts bestowed upon it by&amp;nbsp;mother nature. Some nations have huge oil reserves, so they&amp;nbsp;naturally become rich by drilling and exporting it. However, it is to be remembered that there should also be a demand for that particualr commodity in the&amp;nbsp;national and international markets. If tomorrow, a cleaner and cheaper alternative to fossil fuels is discovered, the demand for&amp;nbsp;oil will&amp;nbsp;go down. This would have a negative impact on the&amp;nbsp;economy of those countries whose main source of&amp;nbsp;income is&amp;nbsp;export of oil.&amp;nbsp;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;imilarly, countries generously endowed with trees, forersts and minerals can produce and sell products which are made out of them provided there is a market for them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We also need to understand that growth of any given economy can not be measured only in terms of those goods and services that generate revenue. Defence and&amp;nbsp;internal law enforcement agencies&amp;nbsp;are a very good example. If the defence forces, police and other law enforcement agencies did not exist, there would&amp;nbsp; be no one to protect&amp;nbsp;the nation and any other economic activity would be impossible&amp;nbsp;because of the constant internal and external threats to the nation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Taking the same argument forward,&amp;nbsp;if there was no agriculture in the country, there would&amp;nbsp;not be enough food for its people and food would have to be imported which would&amp;nbsp;make it very expensive and available only to those who could afford it. Because of this huge expenditure on a basic necessity like food, there would perhaps not be enough funds to divert&amp;nbsp;to other industrial&amp;nbsp;and entrepreneurial activities. The same holds true of education and medical fields. If the&amp;nbsp;level of quality education imparted in a country is low, the workforce won&amp;#39;t be competent enough to contribute significantly to the nation. It might&amp;nbsp;be used as cheap labour though. At the same time, if the population&amp;nbsp; of any given country is not healthy or&amp;nbsp;does not have access to basic health amenities, it&amp;nbsp;can not be expected to be very efficient and productive.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Having said that, times change and with changing&amp;nbsp;times, one sector&amp;nbsp;or the other emerges that becomes a priority for&amp;nbsp;almost all nations&amp;nbsp;that can afford investing into it. For example,&amp;nbsp;Information and Technology is that sector today. It has completely revolutionized&amp;nbsp;every walk of life to say the least. Even wars today have become high - tech;&amp;nbsp;technology holds the same importance that ammunitions do if not more. It is for this reason that nations today have to invest a lot in technology. The nation&amp;#39;s very&amp;nbsp;existence has become dependent on technology for the simple reason that the&amp;nbsp;elements which threaten the safety and security&amp;nbsp;of nations today use high - tech&amp;nbsp;instruments. Therefore it becomes absolutely critical&amp;nbsp;that nations employ latest gadgets to counter them. This also becomes a&amp;nbsp;cycle - new&amp;nbsp;technology very soon becomes obsolete therefore new investments have to&amp;nbsp;be made. This gives birth to a whole new generation of technology&amp;nbsp;empowered weapons industry. Israel is a good example of this.&amp;nbsp;Israel&amp;#39;s economy depends greatly on the defence equipment it exports.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;To conclude, one must keep in mind that a nation is made up of people who are skilled at different jobs. This is what makes calssification of industries possible in the first place. For any nation to succeed, it is imperative that all sectors play their role efficiently so that a nation prospers and remains secure from internal and external threats.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
