Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Clean India or SWACCH BHARAT it is mission that has been strated by our Prime Minister MR. Sri Naredra Modi. The main aim of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;this mission is make India clean and tidy. Awareness of the mission has been moved to each village of the country but implementation of that mission is rather more important than the awareness . Media, students, NGO`s , society , politicians are joining their hands for making the mission sucessful. The sucess of the mission will not be depend on the some groups of communities in thecountry. Each and every person of the country should make their intrest and awareness into action and should join their hands for CLEAN INDIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Especially in viilages and backward areas slums can been seen, where people would live in Unhygenic area. Those areas should be turend out in clean and hygenic. implematation of Clean India should be started from slums and not from raods and colleges. Even Government should also put there efforts to make this mission easier by providing dustbins in each and every part of place, turning out the slums into hygenic with proper housing and sanitation facilites. If person comes to know the beauty in the hygenic place then the maintainace in the place would be done automatically .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Pollution is also a main cause, odd or even theme should be implemented to all the metro cities in India not only in New Delhi. Whole India have to work of the &amp;nbsp;Swacch Bharat to make our Country clean. In India more than 50% are villages, where there would not exist any proper saniation facilies, drinking water facilites. Government should work on these villages and make people get over through this unhygenic habits. Proper sanitation facilites, healthy drinking water should be provided. Every person should have an intrest to keep there places neat and tidy and not allowing others to make it dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; IDEA, INTREST, DESIRE, ACTION are the four powers that can make India clean and tidy. Many NGO`S, communities, students have come forward volunteerly for this mission. Whole India should work and turn their intrest &amp;nbsp;into action for accomplishing this mission and make India clean easier and sooner. Each person in the country should keep their premises clean and tidy and not allowing other to making it dirt. If quater part of our population join their hands together then we can be able to see a CLEAN INDIA sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Every Indian has to take a oath to keep their country clean and tidy, that leads to SWACCH BHARAT.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
