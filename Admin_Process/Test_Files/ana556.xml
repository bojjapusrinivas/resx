Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Every day we read dialy newspaper, we come across a huge amount of information dealing with the trends in various sectors which affect economy of our nation.&amp;nbsp;Most of the sectors which make news on major part on the economic or business related newspapersor magazines&amp;nbsp;include &amp;nbsp;oil sector, airlines sector, automotive sector, export/import sector, pharmaceuticals, agriculture sector, health sector, share/ capital market/ investment sector, banking sector&amp;nbsp;and other sectors dealing with finance and industry.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The progress in these sectors play a major role in driving the economic growth of our country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;According to me or in my views oil/ banking/agriculture and investment sectors are most crucial for the growth of our economy. However , i beileve that since oil industry forms the basic root on which &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;economy of any nation functions , it is most essential of all these setors for smooth running of&amp;nbsp;any economy. Success in oil industry can bring any nation upto such a level or standard where other nations can become &amp;nbsp;dependent on it for even their own economic growth.Example of Middle Eastern countries is a living example in front of all of us. We have seen in the rect pasr these countries have made huge progress on economic front due to growth in oil sector. Even countries like China,Japan and America are always on their way making researches or sea explorations for discovering oil mines.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Oil and petroleum industry is vital for economic growth of any nation&amp;nbsp;emainly because transportion industry&amp;nbsp;largely depends on it. Due to this reason any nation will come to the halt or become standstill if there is dearth of oil in that country . Such a situation would disrupt the otherwise smooth networking of transportation system. and thus lead to cancellation of&amp;nbsp; all ongoing work in that nation which would affect its economy advesely.Therefore due to its basic &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature this industry is most essential for economic growth of&amp;nbsp; economy in any nation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
