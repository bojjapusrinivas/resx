What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is a enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand in india. the out come this gap is unavailable healthcare resouces for the poor. government had taken several steps to fill the gap, but they were not implemented properly.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;for example, the govt of andhra pradesh had implemented a scheme called &amp;quot;Aarogya Sree&amp;quot; under which every white ration card holder can get a free medical assistance in few of the selected hospitals by just enrolling their names to aarogyasree, but this didn&amp;#39;t came out as expected. the reason behind it may be the corruption in every corner.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;there is a huge gap between demand and supply of various medicines, which&amp;nbsp;plays a major role in curing many diseases. the government should take following measures to eradicate(or atleast decrease) the gap&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;1. REDUCTION IN TARRIFS FOR IMPORTING MEDICINES :&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As government impose a high tax on import of medicines, many companies were not willing to export their healthcare products to india. so, reduction of tarrifs will be a sort of booster for them, which increases the flow of healthcare products into the country, which inturn helps in reduction of gap between supply and demand.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2. PROVIDING LICENSES FOR MANUFACTURING VARIOUS HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS :&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Govt must provide licenses to manufacture various health care products to the eligible firms, so that it may help to reduce gap between demand and supply of health care products.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;3. PROVISION OF SUBSIDARIES TO THE POOR :&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Major part of population in india&amp;nbsp;lie below poverty line and they can&amp;#39;t spend&amp;nbsp;more money for diagnosis of a health issue as it may have effect on&amp;nbsp;fullfillment of&amp;nbsp;their family&amp;#39;s basic needs such as food and shelter. so, Govt should provide a few subsidaries to the poor for diagnosis of some major health issues.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;4. INCREASING NUMBER OF GOERNMENT BASED HOSPITALS :&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The number of the govenment based hospitals must be increased and the facilities of the existing must be improved. so, that a commom man can get faith on government hospitals and utilize them to the extent.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Along with the above mentioned&amp;nbsp;measures, government should create awareness among people about the usage of various healthcare schemes that are available to them in various selected hospitals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
