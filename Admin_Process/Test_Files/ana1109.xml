What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health care is&amp;nbsp;a very important aspects in every individual life. when we see across the globe, health care is given a very importance by government of a particular country. The health care system in&amp;nbsp;India keeps on growing,&amp;nbsp;but ultimately it cannot reach demand of the customer. The gap may be the resources which are important, are not available in an appropriate time. There should be a proper measure to be taken by the government of India to fill the gap between the supply and demand of the health care. Health care in western countries, they give much importance to patient care rather than on the business and they believe that customer satisfaction will ultimately leads to the profit of the business.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India, many of hospitals and other health care institutions are mainly concentrating on profits, but not on the satisfaction of the customer. They are hiring the less qualified employee for the lesser price and collecting good amount from the customers for their services. There are very few Health care institutions which provides very good services to the patients, but cost of services in those institutions are very high.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India, Health care institutions are can be divided in to three levels: low level, medium level and high level institutions. In low level institutions, the resources availability may be one of the problem and services offered to the customer are not up to satisfaction of the patient. The cost involved&amp;nbsp;in this type of institutions are very less. In medium level institutions, Resources availability may not be the problem but infrastructure is not good and cost of services offered will be high. In High level institutions, services and infrastructure will be very good. The cost involved in this type of institutions are very high.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The government of India has to take an appropriate steps to fill the gap between the supply and demand of the health care, in order to improve services offered to patient. They may be :&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There should a definite change in the policy framing of each health care institution.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The resource availability in every&amp;nbsp;hospital should be improved.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The hospitals should be updated with new technology, which help to cure the disease of patient&amp;nbsp;in simple and comfortable way.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The cost involved in the services should be reduced in order to improve the patient care.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The other services like ambulance availability, should be improved.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The motto of every hospitals should be the satisfaction of the customer.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Only qualified person should be appointed, to treat the patient.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Service cost in the high level health care institution should be reduced.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There should an inspection from government of India periodically i.e. quarterly, half-yearly or yearly in every institution, to know whether they are following norms and condition of the policy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Every health care institution must follow the rules and regulation framed by the government of India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Services offered by every hospital should available to patient efficiently.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Every hospital should compare its performance from the previous year and should make an appropriate changes to improve the service.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Therefore, In India, proper measures to be taken to improve supply of health care to meet the demand of the customer. Ultimately every hospital should see for the satisfaction of the patient and that will lead them to the profit and make them stay in competition.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
