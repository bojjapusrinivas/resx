To call our nation developed country our techonology must be more advanced and must be accurate and more usefull for the society. Day by day the population of the country is increasing and with the increase in the young generation. More than 80% are young generation with more education knowledge and try to achive higher education to satisfy there needs and society needs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;According to current situvation bullet trains are more usefull to India. Now a days every person is hurry is travelling to their destination. In this fast moving life, society require quick transportation from one place to other which will be satisfy through bullet trains. Bullet trains are advance technology which are faster then other ordaniery trains. This will also help the people to reach their destination fast and safe. Due to increase in population every one are trying to buy own transportation which will increase the traffic on the roads. This is done due to non having of proper commen transportation facility for society. And leads to high air pollution and more accidents on the roads. If we have fast transportation then people will preffer common transportation and this will reduce the polution of air, decrease in use of natural resources, global warming etc. Due to orinary trains are more which will use coal for running it will emits more dangiours gases into air which will lead increase in earth temperature. Use of mordern technology will decrease the use of natural resources and reduces the pollution and decreases the temperature level. But for construction of bullet trains we need to have more budget and more complex framework. currently in hyderabad there is a metro train in progress which was taken up by L&amp;amp;T company. From 2 years we are hering that metro will start but the bullet traind are in to existance. This is due to many reasons. but if it come into existance it will be more usefull to society. Even though we have certain dis advantages for use of bullet trains like if care is not taken it will lead to more accidents and disasters to socity which can be taken care with proper techololigy specialist assistance. If bullet trains come we have more projects on the new technology trains it will help for the more unemployed people to get their jobs and reduce in traffic on roads. This will leads to decrease in unemployment and decrease in poverty line. which will leads to developed nation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Hence i preffer for bullet trains rather than other trains due to it have more advantage than any other things keeping the advantages more preffer for the new technology trains which help us to do our work faster and secured manner. Buy this acivement we can call India as Developed country rather than developing country in some situvations and feilds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
