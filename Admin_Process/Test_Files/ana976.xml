Discuss with examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After globalisation and liberalisation the entire world became a small village, which leads to innovation,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If one product and technology, which has been out dated in one country, companies are playing strategies to introduce it in another country. In this our country getting new technology,&amp;nbsp;Here new technology means new to our company not to&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Digital innovation made our lives simpler because using technology saves our valuable time and energy, It is like a coin on one side we have pro&amp;#39;s and in another side we have con&amp;#39;s!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Some of the examples are: In apartment we are using lift, Imagine climbing a ten floors building with out a lift, Is it possible ? It is possible, but waste of time and energy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Cell phone:&amp;nbsp;Imagine&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;world&amp;nbsp; with out cell phone we can&amp;#39;t even thinking about it, In that way we bound to technology,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;computer: Which changed the phase of human being, and phase of economy of so&amp;nbsp;many countries,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;CARS: Now companies are&amp;nbsp;manufacturing the cars in such a way that&amp;nbsp;they&amp;nbsp;are eco-friendly in nature,&amp;nbsp;Before it was not like this if&amp;nbsp;any car travels for 5. kms,&amp;nbsp;it is use to produce&amp;nbsp;1kg of carbon dioxide due to innovation on cars it has been reduced, Like this we have&amp;nbsp;so many products and software&amp;#39;s which leads our life&amp;#39;s simpler.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I think using technology is not at all a danger, It is entirely depends up on how a human behaves, we have&amp;nbsp;Different people&amp;nbsp;with different perceptions so how&amp;nbsp;we use technology is in our hands, if we use it for good it&amp;#39;s good or if we use it for bad things like: Hacking one&amp;#39;s information,&amp;nbsp;some times it may cost life, so be careful not about technology about your behaviour.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Thank you!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
