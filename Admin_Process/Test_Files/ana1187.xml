<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:32:03 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;1. As India is a country with large population and it is a developing country which is attracting the foreigners to enter into our country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;2. It stands in the second place in&amp;nbsp;terms of population.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;As there is a huge demand for the health care industry but unfortunately the supply is very less than the requirement. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;3. Also India is a mixed economy which is combination of both public sector and private sector. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;The government should implement certain programmes that should facilitate better care for the patients in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&amp;nbsp;4.Hospitals should be constructed for each and every village. Proper food should be supplied to the Anganvadi schools.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Not only supplying should monitor whether the healthy food is given to the children or not. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;5. To prevent many harmful diseases like Swine flue, Chickenpox, Malaria, Polio&amp;nbsp;AIDS, etc.,&amp;nbsp;the government should provide vaccines to the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;6. government should&amp;nbsp;also take care about whether the hospitals are having basic facilities for the patients or not.&amp;nbsp;Based on the population the government should make the policies to supply the healthcare services to the people on and below the poverty line. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;7. The people should be informed to get&amp;nbsp;aware&amp;nbsp;of the diseases which are&amp;nbsp;entering into our country in order to avoid the&amp;nbsp;increase rate of patients in the economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;8. Now the world became the global economy as a result of trade, investments, business relationships, foreign direct investments etc., more&amp;nbsp;multi-speciality hospitals came into existence with latest equipments following speedy procedures for treatments and fast recovery of patients. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;9. But the normal people cannot afford to go to such super-speciality hospitals as their living standards are low. So the government should give some kind of free treatments up to some limited extent based on the kind of disease and the severity of the problems facing by the patients. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;10. The pregnant women are to be given some free food and medicines till their delivery in order to give birth to a healthy baby, so that we can avoid diseases in advance&lt;/font&gt;. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;11. The&amp;nbsp; problems facing by the people who are unable to receive the services should be informed and be given proper services to them. The healthcare services are to be provided for the people in the every corner of the villages in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;12. India should maintain the&amp;nbsp;international standards in providing the healthcare services to the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;13. Proper services should be offered to the patients for the sake of India&amp;nbsp;to be a healthy country which can become&amp;nbsp;one of the most powerful and&amp;nbsp;developed countries in the world.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;14. The main problem is that the supply is less than that of the requirement i.e., demand , the above mentioned are some of the&amp;nbsp;steps which are to be followed in my point of view as per my knowledge.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
