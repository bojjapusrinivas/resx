<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/27/2015 5:12:07 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, I think our lives are going to become more dependent on computers. The reason behind this is, today the environment is VUCA that is Volatile, Uncertain, Challanging or Complex and Ambiguity. We need to adopt the changes and acquire new skills to survive in this corporate world. Most of the jobs are computer based and there is more growth in this industry. Now a days each and every school is offering computer courses to create awareness among the students so that they are not lagging behind when compared to others in the competitive world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Their is a tremendous change in usage of computers, a school going kid can also operate computer and start playing or start surffing net for their casestudies and projects. Computers became an integral part of human lives. Imagine a day with out computer and new technologies today ? It would be difficult and hard to imagine also!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;There are some disadvantages but the advantages are much more than that. It is a positive sign for India, showing that young and upcomming students of this countries are able to adapt the changes in the environment. Computers made our lives easy and it also helped in creating awareness among general public. Most of the news and current situations are updated in websites. By using computers we can store, transfer, change information accordingly and can communicate, post overviews to others.&lt;br /&gt;We are more dependent on computers because each and evrything is available on computer. A layman can also operate computer if he is aware of it. Not only employees, now a days housewifes,children, and grand parents are also using computers. Right from school to railway system or any other bookings are done with in a couple of minutes by using Computers. Increase in technology made humans to develop new softwares and systems so that it will further decrease the work and physical storage.&lt;br /&gt;Route maps, avalability of information and many more are adding a plus point for using computers. There are few disadvantages for people who are addicted and more dependent on computers, mainly their health issues and mental stress. Previously people used to play outdoor games and indoor games which was like stress buster and a healthy way of exercising but now, presnt senario is playing games online with computer as an opponent. &lt;br /&gt;Depending on computer is not wrong but over ulitization may cause problems. Book is replaced with Notepad, Reminders are replaced with Stick notes and what not! every thing is available on net and can use effectively and efficiently to improve ourselves and grow forward.&lt;br /&gt;As technology is getting advance and environment is dynamic, people are dependent on computers.&lt;br /&gt;Initially computers are charged very high and due to high usage of computers by most of them the price of those came down. Most of them are able to afford this.&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add a point that the vision of Microsoft is to see computers on every desk and at every place. Every company is looking for computer skills in candidates. Computers can perform more work with in less time and with an accurate answer than a human can do. Now a days written tests are now conducted online and at times offline to reduce the paper work and decrease the faults or flaws that a human can. I would like to conclude by saying that, Computer dependence helps in developing ourselves to a large extent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013GlobalAutoIndustryOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated and top 10 global automakers grabs highest share in the market, it accounts for roughly 80% of the world wide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in U.S. There are many opportunities to grow in this industry. With in first five months of 2013, GM led with highest market share of 18.0%. Toyota Motors Corp market share was 14.2%, Toyota was leading the market in 2012 and GM stood second highest market share. GM has analysed the market and its competitors so that to formulate strategies and gain more market share to become a market leader.&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of opportunities to grow in this industry and sustain thier leadership in the market. Companies has to know the pulse of consumers and design accordingly, at a lower cost and by increasing profits. They have to research and analyse the demand for the product and tastes, preferences of the consumer inoder to increase their proportion. Companies have to value the customer and emerging tastes in them. They should plan their strategies, either by reverse supply chain or forward supply chain so that it can reduce the production costs and other associated costs, by shifting the plants from high-cost regions to lower-cost regions.&lt;br /&gt;The role of government is also significant, their policies will show impact on these automakers. If there is a strong government with supportive policies, auto industry can imporve more than its previous performance. In late 2011, 13 major automakers have signed letters of commitment with US government to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. It would help the industry to manufacture and produce more products at a lower cost and can also satisfy the customers. This can be done by updating themselves with most advance technology.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 &amp;ndash; Global Auto Industry Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In the first five months of 2013, General Motors Company ( GM ) led with a 18.0% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. ( F ) with a 16.4% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. ( TM ) with a 14.2% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 11.7% market share, and Honda Motor Co. ( HMC ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( NSANY ) at the last spots with 9.5% and 8.1% market shares, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;OPPORTUNITIES &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;To remain competitive, the automakers will need to design vehicles that will cater to consumers in both mature and emerging markets while manufacturing them at low-cost using the most advanced technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;For example, Ford has undertaken "One Manufacturing" strategy, which aims at producing multiple models from plants across the world in order to save production costs and fast adaptation to changes in consumer tastes. The automaker anticipates producing 4.5 models at each of its plants by 2015, up from 3.6 models currently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Further, the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features (which will save money on gas), even on the small and less gas-guzzler vehicles in order to attract buyers. The sale of optional features is helping them offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to large trucks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The automakers continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. According to a study by CSM Worldwide, China and South America together will represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The role of governments is highly significant. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years. In late 2011, 13 major automakers, including Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Volvo, have signed letters of commitment with the U.S. Government to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
