Do you agree or disagree? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="3"&gt;To some extent I agree with the statement, media publishing and telecasting are irresponsible. Media publishing and telecasting &amp;nbsp;are irresponsible because they are more worried about the news and also about the publications not about people&amp;#39;s emotions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="3"&gt;They want to highlight themselves for that reason they will telecast the news covered irrespective of the public opinion. This in turn cause damage to the society.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="3"&gt;Media publications and telecasting are more eager to cover the news and want to be a brand. Main motive of them is to gain public interests towards their publications and to be market leaders.They should think about the society.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="3"&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take an example of the rape case, in this case media &amp;nbsp;tries to cover as much as possible information in order to publish and doesn&amp;#39;t care about the girl and tries to get an appointmnet for an interview with the girl in order to get complete information about the incident but doesn&amp;#39;t bother about the girl&amp;#39;s feelings. They also try to gather information from her parents. Telecasts all the inforamtion covered which in turn would affect the girl&amp;#39;s feelings.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Telecasting the news is not the wrong thing but this kind of news should not be highlighted much&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;span style="font-size: medium"&gt;They should convey the message to the public in a positive tone rather than highlighting the news and should take some responsibility of creating awareness among the people and make them &amp;nbsp;feel responsible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: medium"&gt;They should publish and telecast the news which benefits the viewer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="3"&gt;For example the advertisement of a cigarette attracts the viewer&amp;#39;s to smoke but doesn&amp;#39;t tell the facts that it ruins the life.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: medium"&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times"&gt;According to me media publications and telecasting should take some responsibility and telecast the things that creates awareness among the viewer and also warn them about the dangers/problems they are going to face because of the addiction. This kind of information should be telecasted atleast twice in a day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
