What would be the long term impact of this step on terror financing and creation of unaccounted wealth?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;On the eve of US election results, as the whole world was curiously watching and waiting for the US presidency results. Then came a surprise from another quarter of the world!!! It is nowhere, but from our own land. At the click of the clock at 8:30 PM on November 8th 2016, there was breaking news!!! Mobiles were flooded with messages!!! It is about the new economic policy announced by Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi.&amp;nbsp;It is demonetizing of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was first of its kind for many. In the Indian market much of the currency circulation is through Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000. The new announcement was about cancelling the old notes but can be exchanged in the banks for newer notes. The logic is simple. Though&amp;nbsp;the idea is simple&amp;nbsp;much choas prevailed, many difficulties are being&amp;nbsp;faced by common man, many agetations by different political parties,much affirmation from the Government and so on. So to undersatnd the whole thing will now let us discuss the pros and cons of Demonetization by Indian Government to come to an conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facilitates to be a responsible citizen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India according to research it was found that very less number or less percentage of people are tax-payers even the earning are above the tax bracket. The&amp;nbsp;main reason for avoiding taxes is because the income in unaccounted. Much money is circulated through cash even though the earning are legal. Leave about the non-legal cash.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: Suppose a man owns&amp;nbsp;five flats&amp;nbsp;and he gets rent amounted to 50,000 Rs per month. As his income is above the tax bracket per year he is entitled&amp;nbsp;to pay taxes to the government. But he is not depositing in the bank and thus getting un-noticed by income tax Department and there by avoiding taxes. But after demonetization he is&amp;nbsp;made to go to the bank to get rid of the old notes. Indirectly he is subjected to make his income accounted. There is also another step in waiting&amp;nbsp;to be implemented by Government regarding linkiing property to Adhar card. All the transactions by a particular person need to be accounted.Thus he will be under observation regarding the source of Income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new measures certainly makes a responsible citizen.Thus tax paying people percentage increases the income to the government , thereby helping the government to improve the infrastructure and aiding in growth of the country.It also reduces the gap between&amp;nbsp;have`s and have not`s helping in uniform growth. Because non tax payers are increasing their individual income&amp;nbsp;and at the same time enjoying all the facilities from the government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficulty in getting new currency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the demonetization was introduced the government should have thought about the alternative arrangement for currency circulation in the market. An average educated man can have e-transaction. But much percentage of people in the country are less educated, earning and living on daily wages not able to have e-transactions. They are finding the situation very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Example: The business in the Rythu Market had hardly hit due to non-availability of cash. Due to this many flowers, vegetables and fruits are being wasted every day and the farmers are just dumping the vegetables in the trash because of less shelf life to the given product.The farmers are subjected to&amp;nbsp;heavy lose. Without any fault they are suffering&amp;nbsp;even some patients were not allowed for getting treated in the hospitals because they are not paying in 100/- and only having currency in 500/- and 1000/- that are not acceptable. Thus some of the very important and emergency things are being badly hit&amp;nbsp;for a common man&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyse the long time impact on terror finacing and unaccounted cash it needs to be carefully observed. Because though the idea of implementing is very praise worthy the steps to achieve the impact also plays very important role in analysing the given situation. We need to wait and see for the impact it really brings .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like after much effort while implementing&amp;nbsp;Swacch Bharat after some stage its impact as a whole was not so much effective. It is not the idea but the ways of implementing plays a greater role. So the idea of demonetization is good. But need to rectify the cons that come in the way&amp;nbsp;of its&amp;nbsp;implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping that India will suceed in its strategies&amp;nbsp;to achieve better India for tommorrow`s genertaion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart Elevator Market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Impact of Smart Elevator Market due to modernization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years there is subsequent increase in urbanization. We were of the opinion that it is prevelant in India alone but according to statictics globally also there is subsequent increase of urbanization. In the year 1960 number of people residing in cities was only 34% &amp;nbsp;and in the year 2014 it is 54%/. Thus based on the previous data it is estimated and projected that in between the years from 2015-2020 for every year there would be increase of 1.8% in urbanization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The propotion of population increase in cities is much higher. Obviously due to less availability of geographical space many number of high rise buildins are coming up every year. Due to much modernization of living the demand for high quality of living also increased. Thus to aid in comfort, fast, efficiency and secure vertical transportation demand for smart elevators also increased proprtionately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smart elevators are excellent in&amp;nbsp;its features like assessibility to comfort, providing sufficient space according to the customer need as well providing hygenic condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are also unique in its&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology: Advanced features like intelligent communication, access control and security technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers need: Tailored to customer needs like residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial, hospitality and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Revenue: The expectation for smart elevator market growth is very high&amp;nbsp;as number of high raising structures is about to grow very drastically by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focussed countries for market growth are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed Countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed countries like US, UK, Canada and France are the present market revenue generators. But there is still lot expectation of growth like around 52% for smart elevators markets in these countries as there are many upcoming high rising buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing Countries: There is much expectation from Asian countries like china alone is expected to grow by 53% in high rise structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendors: As the projected growth is significant many vendors of vertical transportation system are shifting focus to smart elevator market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: ThyssenKrupp, Schinder Elevator are some of the vendors focussing on smart elevators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
