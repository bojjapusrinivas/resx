<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:40:09 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand according to my view this is due to many that influence our Indian economy,&amp;nbsp; our country &amp;nbsp;has a huge population it&amp;#39;s one of the highly populated country in the World where poverty is still prevailing, in our country the government is &amp;nbsp;providing many health schemes&amp;nbsp; but most of them are in reach of&amp;nbsp; many rural and underdeveloped areas where the people are not even in a reach of the basic health facilities provided by our government and many charitable&amp;nbsp;trusts.&amp;nbsp;Measures are to be taken to implement various schemes such that they reach even the remote areas&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and are even beneficial to the people as well.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Measures should be taken&amp;nbsp; by our government such that various health schemes are to be implemented in which are beneficial to the people in &amp;nbsp;different aspects and are in reach of the entire population in our country. Many &amp;nbsp;Health centres have to be opened in different areas where Healthcare is not prevailing and in reach of the people. As ours is a developing country where&amp;nbsp;most of the population is &amp;nbsp;in rural areas and many are below the poverty line. The measures should be taken such that the various health schemes provided by our government should be in reach and&amp;nbsp;effort able by all&amp;nbsp;the people, even for free of cost at least to some&amp;nbsp;category of people. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Different schemes have&amp;nbsp;to be implemented based&amp;nbsp;of the sections of people&amp;nbsp;in ages, child care benefits have to be given for new born babies they must be provided with vaccinations regularly, different health schemes for children under 14 years&amp;nbsp;of age such that they are provided with the efficient vitamins which support&amp;nbsp;a healthy growth, for women health schemes which help&amp;nbsp;during pregnancy for the healthy growth of infants, even many middle age benefits &amp;nbsp;and old age benefits for senior citizens which help them with various special privileges has to be provided and even some treatments&amp;nbsp;which are costly and &amp;nbsp;not in reach of the common people are to be provided in free of cost and&amp;nbsp;even in remote areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;finally, I would like to&amp;nbsp;conclude by&amp;nbsp;suggesting that the government has to improve well&amp;nbsp;in Healthcare&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;implement various health&amp;nbsp;centres with all the necessary assistance, with the latest technology in&amp;nbsp;different parts of our country&amp;nbsp;which are beneficial to&amp;nbsp;all the sections&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;people, with&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;at most care and responsibility because &amp;quot;A Healthy India&amp;nbsp;constitous&amp;nbsp;a Better India.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
