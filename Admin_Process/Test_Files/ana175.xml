<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;12/17/2012 4:26:10 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India&amp;#39;s economic matters, there is an excessive tendency towards the thinking rather than doing. Elaborate with examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is a well known fact that India is the biggest threat for the United States of America, giving a great deal of competition in the race of being &amp;#39;World&amp;#39;s No.1&amp;#39;. India as a country has high potential&amp;nbsp;that if channelized in the right direction can do wonders and in no time rule the worlds economy. It is indeed, yet to be accomplished because of the lean attitude of the Indian Government towards the economic policies and measures to be taken for it&amp;#39;s proper implementation. Indian constitution is the world&amp;#39;s lengthiest constitution, and I believe, so&amp;nbsp;are the Indian Economic&amp;nbsp;policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Economically, India is still standing in the queue of &amp;#39;developing nation&amp;#39; We do understand the fact that it takes time to come up with a conclusive decision upon something that has a nationwide impact. However, considering the pace in which the world is almost &amp;#39;running&amp;#39;, we cannot expect mere thinking attitude will ever lead us to the winning edge. Indian Government has many ideas however, till the time a decision is taken it is most of the time, too late or too slow. We have ample provisions for farmers, unemployed youth, other weaker sections,&amp;nbsp;but still they lack in availing the benefit. Why it is so? One of the core reason is because of the untimeliness and improper implementation. Govenment have so latchy attitude towards the economic crisis and needs that it working as a snail is making the issues more grave. The problem arises - (impact measured) - (politcal discussions) - problem increases - (still in discussion phase) - problem increases - (committees set up) - (proper/improper policy framed) - (political drama) - (parliamentary sessions for approval) - problem becoming grave with passing days - (somehow approved) - (policies implemented) - result not even minimal because neither the data nor the economical condition&amp;nbsp;of the country and it&amp;#39;s people, using which the policies were initiated are now same. Quick and timely actions would have helped in tackling the issues being faced in the former scenario and later in&amp;nbsp;controlling new issues form cropping up.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;FDI (Foreign Direct Investment), is the most recent and contencious issue that was moving under the table since more than 5 years. It does have favourable and unfavourable results however, had it been decided 5 years ago or say even 3-4 years, India would have been able to handle the recession in a much better way. During that time the FDI could have helped India in avoiding a situation where it has to take a huge sum from the World Bank to meet it&amp;#39;s interest liablities. India is a self sufficient country, in most of the aspects if not all. Only if the political and economical thinkers start acting on their thoughts with proper policies and implementing the same in accordance to the need, rather than excessively thinking and not acting, India will achieve heights&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;be at the winning&amp;nbsp;edge where is actually aspires to&amp;nbsp;reach and&amp;nbsp;also deserves to be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
