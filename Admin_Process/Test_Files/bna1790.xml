<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/9/2015 5:31:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical care is a basic necessity of citizens, but people are mostly concerned about their well being and not that of the others. Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Medical care is essential for every individual.Here we can think about a phrase "Health is wealth".Any human being can`t avoid health care services in his lifetime,if we are healthy then only we can take care about our well being as well as others in the family like parents and elders.Medical services can`t be commercialized if it is so it can`t reach to more people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; If we consider a case like Arvind eye hospital,more public are experiencing their medical facilities like eye operations and check ups at free of cost especially poor people.So that we can easily understand by observing if &amp;nbsp;health services are commercialized how far it can reach to the public or common people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; People &amp;nbsp;are concerned about their well being,i do agree with the statement wher they are forgetting the humanity.If we help others it means humanity and if we not if we are selfish,nothing like that but as a human being we should be helpful to others especially for the people who are needy for that help.we have to find out that whether the person is genuine or not but &amp;nbsp;here decision can save one`s life.Here time is the important factor,with in a minute we can save one`s life and also we can loose them.So life &amp;nbsp;is important for everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;If we compare with past for health care services availability in india it developed a lot in terms of technology like laser treatments for eye surgeries, implantation in dental complaints, painless procedures for delivery`s,anesthesia and so on.but how many people can afford those facilities and how many are utilizing them and experience the benefit out of them.Most of the common people use to visit government hospitals to avail the services but how many hospitals are equipped with these facilities and providing them to the patients at nominal or free of cost to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Here we can notice one thing that in USA medical services are already commercialized and it is very expensive to avail the services,but major advantage for them is hospitals are well equipped with facilities for almost all types of &amp;nbsp;medical issues.So people from USA and also from other countries are visiting to india for health services which they can afford and turn to healthier which is a very precious period in one`s life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Though in india medical services are little cheaper when compare to other countries it still has to improve a lot like,in few hospitals we can observe that responding to patients is very slow,only after paying the advance payments considering the complaints and so on.Hospitals are not running any charity but they can help few patients who are in needy. They can help few patients in a year or they can donate some money out of their profits to organizations who take care of these type of issues for orphans,oldage people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; One drawback in our country is primary health care centres.These centres are less in number or &amp;nbsp;the existing centres are not functioning properly due to lack of facilities,human resource,irresponsibility in attending complaints and so on.It can be any issue &amp;nbsp;but they are not responsible to their duties as well.If we as a individual feel responsible to few things in our life it may help a lot.It doesn`t look like a big thing but it may save few life`s.Most of the people died due to lack of primary health check ups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In rural areas people most of the people don`t have expose to basic medical facilities,so few organizations like Lions Club are conducting free health camps in rural areas to &amp;nbsp;common people at free of cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;One thing for sure we can say that we can`t get rid off medical facilities in our life,that too in 21st century,because our work culture,eating habits changed a lot like most people are consuming junk food a lot.So medical services are essential and it can`t be commercialise but it may become expensive in near future.so atleast government hospitals and also private hospitals which are positioned in the market can start providing medical services at nominal cost for few patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; If few doctors taken initiative and if it spread to as many hospitals as possible,so that we can save as many life`s as possible and by sharing it will not be expensive for any of them and publis also don`t feel that medical services are not affordable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
