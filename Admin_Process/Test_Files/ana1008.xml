In the name of development, many countries try different things, which sometimes ruin the environment of that particular country. Environment includes the surroundings and the way a place of the country appear.&amp;nbsp;The more greenery the environment, the better is for the country. India is a perfect example for maintaining a good environment as there are many greenery places&amp;nbsp;situated. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Other developing countries like Bangladesh, Dubai, and other Eastern countries must be aware that though they have been developing their countries since many years, the environment must be maintained in a good manner which results in good state of living of humans and more and more development occurs as the people live in the places happily. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Some of the&amp;nbsp;steps to be undertaken&amp;nbsp;are as follows:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;1. Production level: The countries production level is the most important factor in developing a country. Thus, this production level must be done and executed in such a way that the countries environment will not get damaged or effected badly. The production level depends on the supply and demand of the product from that country and those products must be manufactured in such a way that a clean and healthy environment is maintained among the people which results also in a good working culture. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2. Imports and Exports: Any country will depend most on the imported gods if they are not manufacturing the particular products properly.&amp;nbsp;In the&amp;nbsp;same way,&amp;nbsp;exports process is also carried by different countries to make a mark for themselves in the global world. These imported and exported goods&amp;nbsp;must be handled carefully&amp;nbsp;in order to maintain a god environment within the country. It is the responsible of the Import and Export Managers to take care of the products which are coming in or going out so that they may not cause any problem to other countries members and also&amp;nbsp;to maintain a good&amp;nbsp;relationship with other country members.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;3. Wastage/Scrap: Many manufacturing industries throw away little parts after which the process is completed. This ruins the environment badly and sometimes to the worst case. Thus, the members of these industries must not throw these materials as wastage, rather try to use them in any other form. This decreases bad environment up to some extent where most of the wastage is reduced and used in some efficient way.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;4. Recycle: Some of the goods, which once used, can also be used again by the process of recycling which can be helpful in developing a good environment, as&amp;nbsp;a lot of material is used in some or the other way rather than throwing it&amp;nbsp;away without any use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5. Self realization and awareness: Being a citizen of their own country, he/she must feel the responsible of maintaining a healthy environment where he resides or where he/she works. This is the first main criteria for an individual where he can start maintaining a good environment. Once he gets this into his mind, he can change the society with his good acts. He can, therefore, bring an awareness among the other public about the importance of maintaining a good and a healthy environment.&lt;/font&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;6. GO GREEN: Each individual must follow this step compulsorily in order to maintain a neat environment surrounding him. Every organization must make this policy of &amp;quot;GO GREEN&amp;quot; a mandatory for its employees in order to achieve a healthy and good environment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;7. Decreasing sweatshops: Many workers will be working for hours together without any payment. This is called sweatshops. This results in a bad and unhygienic environment.&amp;nbsp;In order to eradicate the bad environment, the number of sweatshops must be decreased. &amp;nbsp;It is mostly seen in the countries like Bangladesh. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
