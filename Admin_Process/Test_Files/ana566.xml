What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to me, it is true to say that&amp;nbsp;living in big cities offer benefits in comparison to rural areas. Big cities are much more developed than the rural ones. Also, the standard of living of people in these cities is better. They enjoy various benefits like, shopping malls, cineplexes, air conditioned offices, good education for children and so on. They earn more because of the various employment opportunities and increased competition. They are aware of the new technologies&amp;nbsp;that are introduced and&amp;nbsp;thus find it easy to adopt and accept modernisation.&amp;nbsp;On the other hand, the rural areas are not so much developed and the people living here are not exposed to all these facilities. They live a simple life with less income because of which they are not able to change themselves according to the change in time. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is important for the people to change themselves according to the world&amp;#39;s changing scenario for overall country&amp;#39;s development. It is easy for the people living in urban areas to change their thought process with the change in their surroundings, but the same is not easy for the people living in rural areas because of the lack of good and modern education. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In order to minimise the disparity between the rural and urban areas in India, the government should take necessary steps towards the development of all rural areas. This can be done by making these people aware of everything that is taking place in other parts of the country, educating them about the discoveries and the innovations introduced to people and encouraging them to easily adapt to&amp;nbsp;necessay changes for their own welfare.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In the end to conclude, the development of rural areas should now become our priority, keeping in mind the rapidly changing economy. If we fail to address this issue well in time, then we might come across various obstacles in the overall growth and development of our country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
