Discuss with examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my view this digital age and modern inventions are neither dangerous nor simpler it depends on the usage of the technology.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;For example Einstein invented dynamite to break the hills and construct roads, bridges, dams etc. But some members used this formula&amp;nbsp;and invented nuclear missiles&amp;nbsp;and warheads for destruction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Like this there are many examples&amp;nbsp;like &amp;#39;internet&amp;#39;&amp;nbsp;it is also depends on&amp;nbsp;way of using it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Many&amp;nbsp;will use internet in many useful ways like:-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;1)To develop business by doing research and develop themselves and sustain in the market and it also useful in many ways in the business.in every department internet is useful in their daily activities. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2)&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Internet is also useful in many ways to&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;the mankind it is useful in&amp;nbsp;education, research, social networking, business development etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Some members use the internet in wrong way for example &amp;#39;Hacking&amp;#39;. it is moist dangerous thing in present day scenario. With the help of hacking, the hackers will hack others system and corrupt their system by sending virus files into others systems with out their knowledge and also with the help of hacking they can steal the confidential information with their knowledge&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;By the above example regarding the usage of internet we can say the modern inventions are neither made our lives simple, nor complex and dangerous it depends on the usage of technology.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We can take the social networking sites as an example for our study. Social networking sites are also invented to develop the relationships of people, but some people use this social networking sites in a wrong way for example their is many evidences&amp;nbsp;regarding this&amp;nbsp;issue that had&amp;nbsp;seen in televisions and also studied in news papers&amp;nbsp; that trapping persons who is unknown to and using them in many ways and also in some cases it leads to suicides also.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; By the above example we can&amp;nbsp;say that the technology invention is mainly based on the usage of it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We cannot say that technology&amp;nbsp;development is not only dangerous for our lives it also made our lives simple and easy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In my opinion we can discuss this present topic in&amp;nbsp;some ways that are useful to the mankind.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;1)&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socio cultural:-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Technology plays an important role in developing the socio culture of the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For example:-With the development of technology in every aspect of humankind like communication facility, transport facility the socio culture of the people also developed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Economical:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; With the help of technology development the economy of a country also develops. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For example with the technology development only &amp;#39;Globalisation&amp;#39; takes place it means any company can launch their business in any where in the world. This leads to the economic development of the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;3)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Political:- &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Technology also plays an important role in the area of political also. Politics plays an important role in developing a country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For example: With the help of technology only the present youth and young stars are enrolling their names in the voters list and using their &amp;quot;Right To Vote&amp;quot; right and electing a good leader for the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:- &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I conclude that the modern inventions are useful to the society and also dangerous. It&amp;nbsp;mainly depends on the way of using it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
