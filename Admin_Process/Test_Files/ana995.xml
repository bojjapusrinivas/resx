What do you think are the major steps that can be taken in present circumstances to push growth in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indian economy expect revival despite rising inflation:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As&amp;nbsp;our country &amp;quot;India&amp;quot; is a developing country&amp;nbsp;we find many changes in the economy especially inflation&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;RISE IN PRICES&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;Inflation plays a major role in&amp;nbsp;affecting&amp;nbsp;the economy , changes should take place gradually seeing to the common people.&amp;nbsp;If our country common people are not&amp;nbsp;up to the mark we cannot&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;expect India to be a developed country. Economy should be developed with plenty of riches in the country. Yes in todays world our country is facing a great problem in inflation which ultimately effects Indian economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Major steps to be taken in present circumstances to push growth in the country:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;1)Indian ministers should be responsible in managing country ,and see to the growth in well being of the people&amp;nbsp;by reducing the high rise in prices.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2)strategic plans towards developing economy should be well organised.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;3)Government should implement better plans for the well being of slums, poor, where there can be improving conditions in order to achieve good&amp;nbsp; status report&amp;nbsp;on developing country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;4)At present circumstances in order to avoid inflation government should provide better working opportunities for common people as well.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5)Government should push our country to achieve a developed country name by taking healthy measures according to long term plans for developing and finding means of living by reducing prices.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With this I would like to conclude, there need to be a perfect change in the Indian economy which cannot be seen in present days due to inflation, there was great problem for purchasing onions which is a basic need for living but still government has time as well as good plans in moulding and changing the present conditions. When Indian people are satisfied with their way of living and financially fit that day we can proudly say our country is a developed country and has great Indian economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
