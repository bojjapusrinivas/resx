Lets for instance take India, which plays a prominent role in provding services to many corners of the world. It has a great sway over the other economies with a cheaper infrastructure and low maintenance costs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the emerging economies in order to attract FIIs are opening up with less restrictions by levying low taxes to the advanced economies. The market size which is huge is being capitalized by many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, we see many advertisements of foreign products in our television. In spite of marketing in their respective countries they also advertise here as the market size of our country is huge. Besides this, even if they can attract a very minimum of 0.01% of population with their strategies it will lead to great amount of profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the above mentioned facts, the costs of the land and labour is very cheap. So the developed nations like US and UK are hiring employees from third world countries. In order to increase the pace of development and also to catch up with the first world nations the developing nations are attracting them with low CSR rates and waiving off some costs which are huge in their respective nations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on the other side of it there is a huge loss that is being incurred by the emerging economies. Because of the competition and advanced marketing tchnologies which are used by developed nations they are outbeating the developing countries. There are also instances when the developed nations after grabbing huge market shares or in case of any losses, have with drawn their investments which leads to unemployment. This is because of sheer irrational decisions taken by the government expecting growth in a short span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to my opinion an economy has to concentrate in commercializing on the comparitive advantage that they possess rather than relying on the other nations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
