<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:29:58 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Indian government has taken an initiative towards the health of the public in its first five year plan. post independence Mrs.Indira Gandhi felt that it was important to develop schemes which would help people in maintaining their health&amp;nbsp;but they did not succeed. Ages passed but there is no improvement in the situation the death rates were increasing day by day due to lack of proper&amp;nbsp; utilization of resources. There are experts who are planning and designing schemes wonderfully but&amp;nbsp; there are no skilful and responsible persons to execute the schemes so that the gap between the supply and demand of health can be reduced.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The world has become money centric people are running behind money they are charging lakhs of rupees from patients but are not&amp;nbsp;giving their best to treat them. The resources available at hospitals are not renewed&amp;nbsp;on time.&amp;nbsp; Few hospitals don&amp;#39;t even maintain cleanliness which leads to deterioration of patients condition.&amp;nbsp;doctors and &amp;nbsp;should feel&amp;nbsp;responsible and do their duty as per&amp;nbsp;the oath taken&amp;nbsp;before joining their jobs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There are many health care facilities like Arogyasree pathakam, free eye check up ,all the&amp;nbsp;expenses of a pregnant women till the day of delivery to be borne by government, free medical camps in remote areas, anganwadi services, free 24*7 ambulance&amp;nbsp;etc. &amp;nbsp;promised by government&amp;nbsp;are executed properly in few places but not in all. Though government is making an effort of making people aware about the schemes through advertisements, awareness camps, and pamphlets there are people who are unaware how to claim and where to claim even if they claim&amp;nbsp;the concerned people are not reacting properly and misguiding people this the scenario that is lingering in India we have everything skill ,proficiency, resources etc but are limiting our selves to promises and &amp;nbsp;half execution but&amp;nbsp;don&amp;#39;t put that into action wherein every one can enjoy the health benefits and stay fit&amp;nbsp;healthcare service is much in demand as&amp;nbsp;health is the wealth of any nation but due to few drawbacks we are not able to strike the balance between demand and supply of health services&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is the responsibility of every citizen to spread the awareness&amp;nbsp;about the schemes available, how and where to claim&amp;nbsp;amongst illiterates, If they are being misguided how to cross check the information&amp;nbsp;and confront the people misguiding them&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;get the service done properly. Health officers should inspect the hospitals once in a month to check whether &amp;nbsp;the apparatus used are working properly and are replaced when not working or not. a call centre should be setup to take all the complaints regarding health services and action should be taken proactively. any person found violating the schemes should be punished . every citizen should develop a feeling of love, care and service from their childhood and should stick to their values which would make them responsible towards their duty of rendering service as there is a saying &amp;quot; Service to mankind is service to God&amp;quot;. if these are followed surely our nation would be called as developed nation rather than developing nation as people are assets of any nation and health is priceless treasure.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
