<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/18/2013 10:26:36 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which sector, in your opinion, plays the most important role in driving the economic condition of a country? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; India, the fast developing nation is today outlined by multiple growth sectors, each of which, are&amp;nbsp;pulling the nation as a whole into an upright shining spot, while ironically competing with each other as well.&amp;nbsp;From power sector, pharmaceuticals, to telecommunications and ofcourse the real estate, the story of Indian economic growth is a meddly of highs and lows. Considering the high calibre talent and enterpreneurship that the country breeds, combined with the aspirations of enthusiastic citizens of growing economy, India has and is bound to boom into the next superpower.Having said that,&amp;nbsp;the harsh realities of Indian growth story&amp;nbsp;that &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;add to the woes of a country struggling to thrive can certainly not be discounted. There are a range of scams such as Coalgate and Railgate which keep surfacing on a daily basis, forcing the country to headstart all over again.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In my opinion, telecommunications sector is a definite rising star of India. Looking back into history and considering the kind of rapid growth that this has been experiencing, it brings us to a point of certainty that Telecom sector is one to bet for. With the global boom in telecom and software industry over the past three odd decades, although gradual, India certainly has been sharing and experiencing this undercurrents of this rapid boom.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Inspite of the 3G scam that engulfed the telecom sector, our minds and the&amp;nbsp;television channels, the growth in this sector seems unaffected. A look at the growth in usage of both mobile users as well as the advanced users utilising the cellular networks for various purposes other than just receiving and making calls, helps us gauge into the prospective growth story that is certainly sustainable.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Moreover, the telecommunications also do act as a backbone for almost all other industries ranging from power to automobile. The ever increasing business usage of telecom facilities for purposes ranging from conferencing calls, international video calling, to the entire software and internet facility systems being based on telecommunications infrastructure, ensures a steady and sureshot long term growth in this sector. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; Comparing the telecom industry to the software industry, which happens to be next industry in vogue, draws distinct and clear disparities that make the telecom sector win. With almost all&amp;nbsp;the business having&amp;nbsp;become software based, it is evident that the continuous maintenance and upgradation of the net based systems will keep the software sector employees occupied for many years to come. However, with most implementations complete and with systems in place, there is a certain slowdown in the growth rate of the software&amp;nbsp;industry. This evaluation, thus, brings us to the conclusion that it the telecom sector that has a direct impact on the economic growth of our country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The key indian players of the telecom industry such as Tata Telecommunications, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone have owned a major market share in the industry over the past few decades.&amp;nbsp;Comparing the market growth rate of these key players with any other sector industry, draws a&amp;nbsp;clear conclusion about the kind of sustainable growth that the telecom sector has undergone. The rate of infrastructure building around the telecom sectors in terms of towers, underground cable and bandwith availability provided by the government, has been suubstantial. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The telecommunications&amp;nbsp;sector forms the head of a nation&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;growth story that lays the foundation for all the various other sectors. In a developing economy, where the market growth is defined by the supply and demand ratio, the telecom sector lays ahead because of the undisputed demand, atleast for a few more decades to come. The &amp;#39;Incredible India&amp;#39; empowered by a strong telecom sector is bound to grow in this world of &amp;#39;Incredible&amp;#39; telecom systems. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
