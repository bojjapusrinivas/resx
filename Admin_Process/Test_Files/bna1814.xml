<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/9/2015 5:27:50 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical care is a basic necessity of citizens, but people are mostly concerned about their well being and not that of the others. Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical care which is now considered as a growing sector for improving the businesses in the pharamcy, hospital , and also coming with innovative products for curing some diseases the we can see a rapid change in the market day to day when compared to the past scenario the medical field has been now days seem to be &amp;nbsp;a great opportunity for the employees working with them in the production plants .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical care should be taken by each and every individual with considering all the health hazards but people are not much care d about their health when they are not in a &amp;nbsp;a danger situation recently we can observe what is happening with in our surroundings with swine-flu disease people were aware about that disease before 3 three years when it first affected people at that people used to not evn care about their health and now whwn it has spread like a virus in recent days people are cared like taking vaccination.from this we can observe how people are much cared about their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can see many government`s in their states are implementing the benefical for the disease afftected people like providing some benefits . so people should know and they should also spread like a virus to people with their mouth talk like take care of the health because this is the one which makes us be with good energy &amp;nbsp;the reason today we surviving in the market is to be healthy and now days people are changing a lot like they are much interested in financially free then caring about their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coming to the life style today people are not interested spending for their good health and they are much cared having a luxury life with owning a car or a duplex villa.what i mean to say all this the to be given pripority for the medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one most important caution given by cigaratte company like" smoking is injurious to health " but our people they won`t even consider they much prefer in having a cigarette and considering the same situation for the medical if we say people to go &amp;nbsp;through the medical treatments with regularcheck ups we find people very rare who are prefering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are seeing now days many teenagers are &amp;nbsp;affecting with cancer diseases we cant observe things like why this is happening so it may be with changes in the today`s halth problem and coming to the past yeras we used not so see many multi-specialtity hospitls with great infrstructure an medical equipments we can say the generations are leading to many changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my observation in the recent days with people who are financially sound are much interested tking care about their health when of my neighbour was affected with cancer when it can`t be cured here he rushed to the American hospital so tht we can say that people are much interested in curing the disease by even moving to the other country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been trend &amp;nbsp;recent for the film stars like if a kid who is suffering from &amp;nbsp;some disease may leave us in a few days the film strs are going pay condolences to their family.Recently in the Hyderabad A kid want to be a police commissioner for a day hyderabad commssioner fulfilled his dream by opting his position for a day.we can say that the people are like much cared after infecting the disease but not before .If all the film stars campaign towards the public and spread a message to care about it would lead to many changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can see that the few bollywood stars and also the local film stars are promoting for polio drops it is so ggod atleast people are getting aware and now the polio was seen a good progress by public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;changes won`t occur in a day it takes time so people should also spread to the people who are not aware in rural areas we can with use of plastic also may lead to some disease like viral all those should be stopped .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the new government which came into the power saying "swach-bharath" that is like to maintain all our surroundings clean and we all can be healthy it is also &amp;nbsp;promoted by the film stars and public representatives &amp;nbsp;even our Prime minister`s advertisemnts are also broadcasted daily in the television.As we can`t get a faster progress with a &amp;nbsp;change this willl lead with increase in the percent of the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now i would liketo &amp;nbsp;say &amp;nbsp;to consider a good &amp;nbsp;medical care for the people and &amp;nbsp;the organisations who are involved with public like providing health care or some medical products consider it as an essential basic need take with daily changes into market and public should prefer well being life and live healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
