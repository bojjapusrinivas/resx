To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ans- Yes I am Agree with this statement, Because the mass media is our frame of the country from that you can easily get the knowledge about market also the country&amp;#39;s wealth. In india&amp;nbsp;also in abroad&amp;nbsp;peoples are always try to get the knowledge without much difficulty. Mass media is the blood of the country, they always delivered the quality and exact information to the people. The mass media like television is the live source of generating knowledge towards peoples, every moment of of information that they would delivered to he people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Apart from television, Newspaper is the great and essential source of information for public, through newspaper u can read the fact which is already happened but in television its live telecast. In our country everyone having the knowledge about market also our country through mass media, even&amp;nbsp;it helps the students aware about the general knowledge also about the current status about our country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The mass media is working too hard to getting the information from every source by proper research and also got help from some research institution. Now a days peoples cant live without mass media because every one is busy in their life for earning or for their career so don&amp;#39;t have much time to individually get the knowledge from market place , Even Internet also another source for getting the knowledge but not better the mass media. In rural area where have &amp;nbsp;no internet service or any kind of advance technology to get the knowledge, but television and radio is the primary and main source&amp;nbsp;aware about the country or market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In our world&amp;nbsp;there have many sources to get the knowledge about your country and world but the mass media is the only and essential path to get the knowledge. The mass media is always help devlop&amp;nbsp;your knowledge through updating their information in every second or minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is not only helping the general public but also it very important or essential&amp;nbsp;source for providing information towards corporate world. generally every corporate world have a research department for generating contents or information about the market place because this information will help to know about your position in market place and also it also help to make decision for any financial investment in future. It is a essential tools for decision making process. The corporate world always expecting from mass media also partially dependent on it. The mass media evaluate the market and also provide&amp;nbsp;awareness &amp;nbsp;about the structure of economy of our country. So that information will make&amp;nbsp;help to the company for any changes in their business. It also works as a risk calculator for whether you should invest or whether not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Generally in initial period like 3 to 4&amp;nbsp;decades ago, peoples are survived a lot because shortage of source to get knowledge, that time there had no advance technology to delivered the information to public. Specially if i&amp;nbsp;talk about the rural area where had not any television and also not properly reached news paper then u think how difficulty to survive. They&amp;nbsp;had always&amp;nbsp;feel like they are out of this country even they&amp;nbsp;are able to take any decision which ll be better for them. But now each and every villages are connected with our centre directly only because of mass media, through their proper information or knowledge peoples are feeling like everything in our hand because now they knows about their rights only because of mass media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So now each and every publics depends on mass media even they wont to be creativity and innovating, its not only affect on our personal way of thinking but also in the corporate world. Everyone having the capability to resolve the problem but nobody wants accept even not trying to identify their potential. All are not born with creativity but you ll be when you go through a situations because situation is the frame&amp;nbsp;to make you&amp;nbsp;creativity or innovative. The mass media is the main part of this situations because everything have some advantages also attach with some disadvantages. In present generation they have lots of opportunity to be creativity but its depends on you that in which path you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
