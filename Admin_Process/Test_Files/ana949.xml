<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:28:55 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we in 21st centuary,the scope for minor flaws in healthcare&amp;nbsp;can affect our countries growth.T&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;he topic for this essay is asking us about what our government should&amp;nbsp;do to improve health care in india,In india the population is growing day by day and it has reached 2.3 billion in&amp;nbsp;currently&amp;nbsp;held census,this demand serious action need to be done&amp;nbsp;for growing demands for health care in india.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In india there are 3 categories for people reside the one is upper class who have access to better health care and second is middle class who have also access to health care&amp;nbsp;but there size in terms population in expanding very fastly,the third class is lower class who are&amp;nbsp;major of our population and they have very limited access to healthcare.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The healthcare in india is suffering a major problem of less no. of doctors and infrastructure in terms of hospital and medical equipments,there ratio of doctors and the patients are very low.there are 1 doctor for 1900&amp;nbsp;pepole.This is causing major problem in terms of demand and supply in health care sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The indian medical association had published several reports on this problem,so that is could be brought to notice of goverment of india for timely action.The baisc issue to health care is the hospitals which are very less in accordance to number of people in india.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In our county most of the population are residing in rural india but rural india lack proper infrastructure which is the need of hour,as we are growing in terms of GDP and other finacial&amp;nbsp;parameters&amp;nbsp;we need to develop&amp;nbsp;our&amp;nbsp;healthcare accordingly as this enormus population is the main key for india&amp;#39;s development in future and they need to be given proper medical care so that they could give there 100% for the growth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The goverment&amp;nbsp;of india should make more expenditure to develop the healthcare sector in india,as we lack this basic aminites to be called as developed county.at present stage we are very backward in&amp;nbsp;global ranking of healthcare,we are even backward than some of the african countries which is shamless for&amp;nbsp;us.Most of&amp;nbsp;the people in india are suffering with various&amp;nbsp;kinds of desises which can be cured&amp;nbsp;with proper medical tretment but due to no or&amp;nbsp;inadeqaute medical&amp;nbsp;fecilities they suffer a lot and even loss ther precious lifes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In my views government should do lots of expanditure in this sector by investing in public hospitals and medical collages through which more no. of doctors can be passed out to serve this county,they must&amp;nbsp;plan a proper stratergy to tackel this problem by taking account for most needy&amp;nbsp;section of population which&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;lower class and middle class. They must build government hospitals and govt. medical schools&amp;nbsp;which are subsidies for study by government so that many of the students gets to study&amp;nbsp;medical to become future&amp;nbsp;doctors,More and more no. of public medical&amp;nbsp;centre must be opend with basic medical&amp;nbsp;fecilites so that in case of immediate requirement of treatment can be given at initial time,The hospitals must be opend almost in every village of the county and should have at least basic equipments for treatment like x-ray machines and ultrasound machines etc,and&amp;nbsp;permanent doctors should&amp;nbsp;be appointed&amp;nbsp;in the hopitals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Then in second stage the govenment should open district hospital with advanced medical care to&amp;nbsp;meet the requirement critical patients and should have medical collages,and they should be&amp;nbsp;build according to the size of population&amp;nbsp;exsisiting and future expansion&amp;nbsp;in that district so that supply and demand&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;be meet.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In 3rd stage the govt. should open AIMS like hospitals in&amp;nbsp;all the states capitals&amp;nbsp;and prominent&amp;nbsp;cities across india to meet the demands&amp;nbsp;of healthcare and these institues must have most advanced&amp;nbsp;tretment machines to meet world class standrds.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;one more step government can take is that they&amp;nbsp;can ask priavte sector to invest in this field&amp;nbsp;but they should build these hospitals in rural inida so that these hospitals can benefit the rural populations also and healthcare can be improved drastically and also they should promote monthly health care&amp;nbsp;to the common people by giving special schemes in terms of medical health cards and free checkups at specific date in a month.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We have saying HEALTH IS WEALTH so to see our county more wealthier we must look upon our peoples health and their medicalcare to build a healthier nation to reside.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
