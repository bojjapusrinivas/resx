<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:31:20 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Health is wealth. If health is not taken care then there would be a&amp;nbsp;loss in terms of time and money&amp;nbsp;for any individual. Yes,&amp;nbsp;In India there is enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. India is a developing country.&amp;nbsp;Government has to take care of the people in very efficient manner.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I strongly believe that government has to come forward and organise regular health camps majorly in rural areas. Regular health check ups would be an added advantage for people in the country where in the diseases can be diagnosed in early stages and treatment can be advised accordingly.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Medicines for the diagnosis should be provided in time for any patient. Extra care is to be taken for any highly risk patient by providing very good medicines. In rural areas, many of the people are not educated. So, regular seminar about health should be conducted and educate them about the importance of the health. Precautions to be followed by the people need to be more concentrated while educating. Awareness is to be brought among them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Coming to the cities, towns and district level, Government should make sure that there&amp;nbsp;is a&amp;nbsp;multi speciality&amp;nbsp;hospital with&amp;nbsp;eminent facilities within range of minimum&amp;nbsp;5 km from rural areas so that in&amp;nbsp;case of emergency patient should not&amp;nbsp;suffer. On setting up the&amp;nbsp;hospital with all the facilities patient can be taken care off.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Supply of medicines shouldn&amp;#39;t&amp;nbsp;become a shortage for any patient. Hence, Government should be able to monitor all the medical halls/shops and make sure that the&amp;nbsp;requested medicines are available at the right time and all the time.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Viral plays a major role in spreading the disease. If there&amp;nbsp;is any such thing recognised by the government, precautionary medicines or dosages need to&amp;nbsp;be provided in prior&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;all the medical shops&amp;nbsp;which would be a great help for the people to avoid the&amp;nbsp;spreading of the disease.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;For Example, Flu was&amp;nbsp;one of the threat&amp;nbsp;to which people were afraid of. Of course, the necessary precautions were then taken care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Majorly government hospitals should be maintained neat and tidy. Availability of 24/7 nursing and doctors helps patient in case of any emergency. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Now a days corporate hospitals have become money minded. For a simple check up they are costing more and normal people are unable to afford the price. Costs should be set by the government so that the prices are in within the range of normal people. If any patient got admitted for a simple disease&amp;nbsp;which can be taken care at home&amp;nbsp;or cured at home the charges are too high.&amp;nbsp;For example, a patient gets admitted for fever and treatment is done for the patient is just I.V Fluids and some routine&amp;nbsp;tests&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the bill charged&amp;nbsp;is Rs.10000/- &amp;nbsp;. In this case, patient diagnosis&amp;nbsp;may be cured by&amp;nbsp;a simple tablet for which the hospital people says that admission is compulsory.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the demand is more supply should also be more. Healthcare industry is one of the profit making industry in India. Investigation about the patient case sheet need to be organised if any patient gets admitted into the hospital by the government. There are private organisations who takes care of these investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are Public and Private Insurance Companies who provide insurance individually/group. There are certain healthcare private organisations who process the claims of a patient if the patient is having Insurance. Health claims are flooding which is causing Insurance companies a huge loss sometimes. These type of claims need to be restricted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Government should make sure that any hospital should have proper number of beds, certified doctors, more number of nurses who can assist and help the patient who joins the hospital. No patient should suffer&amp;nbsp;after admitting into the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
