<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1/21/2015 10:21:01 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you agree with the concept of &amp;ldquo;make in India&amp;rdquo;? Can we have an efficient economy with better lifestyle for an average Indian citizen with this concept? Also elaborate if &amp;ldquo;make in India&amp;rdquo; could be a good initiation to achieve the set target for &amp;ldquo;made in India&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Being an Indian I really support the concept of "make in India". Because "make in India" will make&amp;nbsp;India to better country in terms of economy growth. There are many advantages if we believe and implement this&amp;nbsp;concept.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;What is Make In India?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Make in India is nothing but whatever the products or goods and services which&amp;nbsp;we are using in our daily life should be manufactured or produced in our home country itself. You may ask, What difference does it make? It will obviously have an impact on the efficient and better Indian economy by thus making lifestyles of Indians in much betterway and making India a better place to live in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;How does it make a difference?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Most of products, goods or services used by INDIANS are getting manufactured in other countries. Right from the shampoo to the dress we wear are from other countries. Be it Automobile industry (Cars, Two wheeler ), Mobile Industry , Chemical Industry etc etc whatever for that matter most of them are getting manufactured in other countries. As&amp;nbsp;India is importing foreign players products and services, India has to pay the huge tax. So in order to reduce Tax and for some other reasons government of India is encouraging "Make In India" concept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;What more benefits do India have ?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Economic Growth: Make In India will certainly have high impact on Economic growth. Rupee value against Dollar will increase. The standard of Rupee&amp;nbsp;rate will increase in international market. India will have more opportunities in doing multiple businesses in multiple sectors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Jobs: If different industry`s start manufacturing in India, obviously the chances for the employment for Indians will grow. By creating many jobs in multiple sectors for fellow Indias will&amp;nbsp;reduce the unemployment figures to drastic level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Proud feeling: On most of electronic gadgets&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;we can see that "Made in China". Similarly on automobile engines "Made in Germany". Likewise, many things are made by other countries. Is there&amp;nbsp;India`s name is on any gadget or something ? to my knowledge, NO. But once we start making goods here in India, assume that great feeling seeing our own country`s on some gadget or machine like " MADE IN INDIA". Great feeling! right?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Conclusion: However, as we all know that an Indian Economy can be more efficient if we start using products (or goods) and services which are manufactured here and should be used here. If every citizen of Inida starts using a good or service which is completely made by Indian company&amp;nbsp;will have more impact on Indian Economy making more effiecient in the world. As someone said, if every indian consumes or utilizes products or services completely made by India the dollar rate would reach under 15 Rupees within 12 weeks or so. So, I obviously support the concept "MAKE IN INDIA"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
