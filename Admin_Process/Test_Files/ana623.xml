What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing Benefits of living standards in terms of area of living ,can be termed as a cognitive value proposition ,which is directly linked to individual perception about its own living standard .Any individual ,being asked about the pros and cons of living in rual and urban areas ,can count a&amp;nbsp; a fingerfull resons for both,provided he must not be a urban dweller .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;But,in a general percptual comparison of urban an rural living ,the former, no doubt will get a high prefrence than&amp;nbsp;the later .If&amp;nbsp;we look&amp;nbsp;at this matter in Indian perspective,it will not be a very wise of thinking ,to choose for a urban living .In&amp;nbsp; India ,there is a huge disparity between urban and rual living standard ,in terms of economic oppurtunity,education,health facility,entertainment options and many other living requirements .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Similiarly,we can count many reasons for why it is very&amp;nbsp; tough to lead&amp;nbsp; a rural living .Apart from the lack of urban advantages ,even the lack of basic facilities which disincentivise the rural areas.In isolated interiors of india,it is even hard to get a proper outlet of drinking water,and it is even sarcasticaly ridiculous to thinkf of elctricity for rural dwellers.To make the things even harder ,in many parts of rural india ,a proper and regular road connectivty is a matter of government apathy .Education ,primary to secondary ,is another factor of negation for rural areas ,which is very few to find&amp;nbsp; in these nonurban settlements .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Counting on these factors ,we can see a huge flux of rural population coming to urban centers of india ,in prospect of better living standard .It is very general trend to observe a huge chunk of rural population from Bihar and eastern UP,coming to delhi or people form bengal and Odisha moving to mumbai,surat,ahmedabad ,in prospect of better income oppurtunity .Though these urban centers and some emerging industrial and trade hubs,has enough capacity to absorve these internal migration,it has been observed that ,this kind of movement is hampering the urban economic growth ,in a numerous way .Drinking water shortage ,electric load shedding,Traffic congestion, hapazard residential growth,crime are some of&amp;nbsp; the outcome due to imbalance in urban civic capacities and increaese in population .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Presently,government in center and states has taken due cognisance of this emerging mismanagement and rolling out number reactionary and proactive measures to fix the national problem .In&amp;nbsp; long term proactive measurement government is taking sleu of measures to stop the migration of rural population to urban areas in first place .MNREGA,RHM,Right to education are some of very active policies which are taken to stop this kind of migration .Apart form this,road connectivity,education facilities,electricity facility are now been doled out to many villages across the country .To nurture and empower the rural woriking population various steps&amp;nbsp;towards &amp;nbsp;handicraft,new agricultural&amp;nbsp; processes,picsiculture,floriculture is now being taken by government .connectivity of panchayats through egovernance, medical facility by conncecting remote areas to a network of hospitals,banking and finacial inclusion,microfinance,postal connectivity are some of the emerging concepts on which government has already taken first step assiduously .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Looking at the current trajectory of devlopment in rual areas ,it can be adjudged that in coming dacade&amp;nbsp;,rural migration will surely be a thing of past .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
