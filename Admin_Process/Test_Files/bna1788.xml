Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In todays current indian situation medical care is mostly important to citizens. yes the people are more concerned about their well being than others this happens commonly to every individual. at maximum people are concerned about their lifes and their family and are less concerned about the public. this can be happen only when the people realise about the danger coming like swine flu and other diseases like ebola. so to erradicate this problem the government should take intiative of not only bringing awareness about their diet and what food to eat. for example, the ebola has out breaked because of eating ebola effected monkey this commonly happens in african contries because their is tradition of eating the animal. but, they do not know about the danger. so, the government should ban such type of food into the market and bringing awareness into public and making them realize about the danger. this can be done by campaining of the virus and promoting good food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Secondly, the swine flu is brokeout in several regions in telangana. and the public are least concerned about the danger in this weather conditions. so, the public should realize that the swine flu is caused by dust and air pollution. they must be concerned in keeping their surroundings clean and by bringing awareness to their neighbours too. so for this kind of medical care the medical services should be implemented by the government and private organisztions by promoting, advertising and providing the masks to the public. by giving this medical sevices to private sector this will more hype and the reduction in this disease will be less effected. mostly the government should sanction more budget into the medical services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;here, the government plays a major role in implementing medical servics. for example in telangana region particularly in hyderabad their are only few number of government hospitals. for example gandhi and niims hospital. so, here in telangana region the population is more and their are more number of patients coming into the hospitals. so, the government should increase the budget for medicals services by opening more number of branches in the surrounding areas in all the regions so that the patients can reach the hospitals quickly and can be treated more with enough waiting area and by not having any delays. for this the good eaxample is by visiting one of the two bif hospitals like ganghi and niims. then we can clearly see the ambience and infrastructure of the hospital. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;by above wxample the medical services should completely be commercialised, but the government should take initiatives by looking into their services cost and revenue so that the public should not suffer of the high prices. the government should issue some policies that the cost of some disease should not exceed more than the estimated amount. if the government does this thing the commercialised medical services will be appropriate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly we should bring awareness into public about the ambulance service. most of the public are less cared about giving way to the ambulence. this cannot happen within nights but traffic in hyderabad also plays a major role here. not only the public should be aware but the governement should focus on the traffic issues. for this to be implemented the traffic police should play a major role he is the person who is responsible for the juctions. the traffic police should be trained in a way that they should be able to figure out the ambulence and he should give a clear way to the next junction and should share the information to the next juction traffic constable about the ambulance headed your way and be alert. same as like a politician travels in heavy hyderabad traffic without interruption. if this the police and traffic combined effort can bring success to the medical services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly the medical service provided in goverment hospitals and private hospitals is wastly different in providing service. so, here is a problem in public. the problem is if a patient goes to &amp;nbsp;a private hospital they take more care and the ambience will be astonishing and the clealiness will be more and the patient will be survived with experienced doctor and if we go to a government hospital no one care about the patient. so the problem here is the public are more aware that if is going to join in a private hospital he will be alive and if he joins the government hospital he assumes that he will die. and in many cases in the government hospitals the corruption is more if the patient pays more money then he is goping to be specially treated and if not he is thown away and one cares him a lot. so to irradicate this kind of problem the government should take strict actions against the hospitals policies and stoping corruption by arresting the one who is responsible. and bringing new technology into their service. and the management of the hospitals should be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their are some reasons why medical services should be commercialised. way back the hyderabad has a medical service so called 108 ambulence service which was a hit when introduced and successfully runned for few years. then after that the government started sanctioning less budgets and the service is now in stake position. now the 108 service has good coverage area so gaining this information as an advantage any private sector can take this into their responsibility and may run the service. the service is good which is soo helpfull but killing it is not a good option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;finally i conclude that the medical services should be commercialized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
