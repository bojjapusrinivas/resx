He also ordered banks to maintain a liquid cash of about 750crores and only those banks which have &amp;nbsp;750cr liquid cash will be &amp;nbsp;considered as a schedule bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Meeting are being conduted by all developed countries to overcome the problem.One example of this is the recent BRICS meeting which held at newdelhi, prime minister Dr.Manmohansingh has addressed the meeting.Dr Manmohn singh is also trying to escalate the issue to the world . He also met Barrack obama, president of u.s.a and valdimir putin president of russia to improve the conditions globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; china has started a free trade zone (ftz) in shangai, where if any country wants to establish an indudry or company will get &amp;nbsp;tax exemption . In this way china is trying to attract foreign investors .India is also trying in many ways ,as a part of this india has passed a resolution in the parliament i.e &amp;nbsp;is fdi, allowing 100%fdi ,through which india is trying to attract foreign investment which give us employment and wil increase the economic condition. Chidambaram , finance minister has given a call to all nri&amp;#39;s to come back india, as he said nri&amp;#39;s will get many benefits as a part of increasing the financial condition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;so lets hope that entire world will overcome the the current economic conditions very soon .Developing countries have to play a major role in this issue. To achieve this not only developing countries but also less developed countrie should focus on global crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
