What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In India the gap between the healthcare supply and demand&amp;nbsp;is due to many reasons. one among them is&amp;nbsp;less number of doctors in the country. In our country mainly some metro cities like hyderabad, delhi, mumbai etc., only dont have this problem. Apart from this cities there is a big gap between healthcare supply and demand. This is mainly seen in remote areas, where they dont have any hospital nearby and people have to travel some distance to find hospital. This situation is because of lack of facilities and number of doctors to serve.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In remote areas&amp;nbsp;like adilabad, srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh&amp;nbsp;and many other areas in India even today people die because of viral infections, which spread very fast and infect many of the people. The government has to educate such people over there to go to hospitals and dont opt for natural medicines which sometimes dont work. By educating the people about modern techniques to cure different diseases will make them think about it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The goventment should&amp;nbsp;not only educate the people but also they should make sure that the appropriate healthcare is available for them. In Andhra Pradesh and some other states the government has started 104 services which move on to villages and does regular checkup to the people. This services some have decreased the gap but the actual gap is enormous.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The available number of doctors in India are less to fill this gap. The government has to establish new colleges to increase the number of doctors by which we can solve this problem to an extent. All the doctors will not be willing to work in villages, there must be change in their way of thinking. Every doctor should learn some ethics that, he has become a doctor not to make money but to serve people also.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Private sector in health care:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There&amp;nbsp;are many multispeciality hospitals are there in cities and towns. These hospitals have to conduct some health camps around there locality so that the needs of people over there will be served. The government should support the hospitals in running this medical camps and government should conduct such camps to reduce this gap.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Medicines should be provided by the government to the poor people who cant afford and in some cases of if the medicines are costly the government should subsidize them. The private pharmacies are established all over the country to fill the gap between demand and supply. But, there are more places where we cant find them. The government should supply medicines to such people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;These are some ways by which healthcare supply and demand gap is to be filled&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
