Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times;"&gt;YES, I THINK OUR LIVES ARE GOING TO BECOME MORE DEPENDENT ON COMPUTERS AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES AND YES THIS DEPENDENCE IS GOOD FOR THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT,BECAUSE WE NEED TO CHANGE ALONG WITH THE CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT, AS CHANGE IS STABLE AND CONSTANT.THERE IS A RAPID DEVELOPMENT IN THE INCREASE OF THE TECHNOLGY.INCREASE IN THE TECHNOLOGY GAVE RISE TO INCREASE IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES,AS A RESULT WE ARE SEEING MANY CHANGES IN OUR SOCIETY,COUNTRY AND THE WORLD AS A WHOLE.COMPUTER IS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE TECHNOLOGICL ADVANCE.IN SIMPLER WE CAN SAY THAT,COMPUTER IS AN OUTPUT OF THE TECHNOLOGY.HERE COMES THE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times;"&gt;WHAT IS TECHNOLGY? TECHNOLOGY IS A GREEK WORD DERIVED FROM THE WORD "TECNIK" WHICH WERE USED BY JAPANESE,WHICH LATER CHANGED INTO THE WORD CALLED "TECHNOLOGY".TECHNOLOGY CAN BE DEFINED AS AN-"APPLICATION OF KNOWLEDGE IN PARTICULAR AREA".WITH THE HELP OF TECHNOLOGY MAN COULD ABLE TO COME OUT WITH MANY NEW THINGS, INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND NEW PRODUCTS.THE TREND HAS STARTED RIGHT FROM THE INVENTION OF FIRE,WHEEL ETC,.LATER THE INVENTION OF PRINTING PRESS,TELECOMMUNICATION,COMPUTERS,INTERNET HAS COME INTO THE EXISTENCE.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times;"&gt;INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPUTER HAVE CHANGED THE LIFE STYLE OF A HUMAN BEING.COMPUTERS HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF THE COMPLEX TASKS INTO MUCH SIMPLER TASKS.EARLIER IT WAS USED TO PERFORM THE CALCULATIONS QUICKLY AND EASILY.APART FROM CALCULATIONS,IT IS VERY MUCH USEFULL FOR STORING THE DATA IN THE FORM OF THE DOCUMENTS.WITH THE HELP OF THE INTERNET EVERY INIVIDUALS ARE PERFORMING MULTIPLE TASKS.AN INDIVIDUAL GATHERS LOTS OF INFORMATION FROM ROUND THE WORLD BY JUST SITTING BEFORE THE COMPUTER.AN INDIVIDUAL GETS ACCEESS TO EVERY PART OF THE WORLD WITH THE HELP OF COMPUTER.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times;"&gt;NOW A DAYS,AN INDIVIDUAL IS MORE DEPENDENT ON COMPUTER.BECAUSE,THEY PERFORM ALL THE TRANSACTIONS VERY QUICKLY AND EASILY AND CAN COMMUNICATE WITH EVRY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD.OUR EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES BEGINS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY IN PARTICULAR WITH THE COMPUTERS.WITH THE HELP OF COMPUTERS ORGANISATIONS COULD PERFORM THEIR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ONLINE AND MAKE ONLINE TRANSACTIONS,CONDUCT ONLINE MEETINGS THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCE,RIGHT FROM THEIR EXISTING LOCATIONS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times;"&gt;THE COMPUTERS ARE VERY MUCH USED IN SCHOOLS FOR EDUCATION,USED IN THE FIRMS TO MAKE TRANSACTIONS AND HIGHLY USED IN TRANSPORTATION LIKE RAILWAYS,AIRWAYS,ROADWAYS FOR MAKING ONLINE RESERVATIONS.THIS MADE INCREASE IN THE PURCHASES OF THE COMPUTERS WHICH MADE THE HUMANS TO BECOME MORE DEPENDENT ON COMPUTERS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
