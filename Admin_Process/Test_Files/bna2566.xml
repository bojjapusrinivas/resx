Suggest measures to be taken by the government to fine-tune the digital payment/cashless economy.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Demonetization has took place several times in india.Recently,on 8 november 2016 Prime minister Narendra modi ji had banned 500 and 1000 rupees notes in order to control corruption and increase indian economy.This decision had big impact on common people because of no cash in ATMs. Demonetization helped to bring up black money from many personalities who didnt pay taxes and stored black money in form of assets and liquid cash.later on modi ji released new 500 and 2000 rupees notes to help commom people.demonetization has both pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge amount of black money came in light,goverment found crores of money which is illegal from politicians and industrialists.corruption has reduced to some extent.demonetization hepled people to move from liquid cash to digital cash.paytm,phonepay etc.,had become very useful and important part of everone`s life,even a pani poori vendor use paytm this hepls to know how techology is important and essential in today`s world .Demonetization hepled making urban area to digital literate. it plays a major role increasing in indian economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the common people had suffered because of demonetization.politicians and industrialists saved their money in form any asset government couldn`t find the total amount of money,so demonetization couldn`t stop corrution completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures to be taken by the government to fine-tune the digital payment/cashless economy:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government can give classes to urban area people how to do digital payments because most of the people are not willinging to use cashless payment ,they it is not secure to pay digitally.government should make cashless payment is mandatory then everyone will use it which inturn makes cashless economy possible.Government can advertise through television and social networking sites about benefits of cashless economy.Tv and social networking sites are strong means to connect with people.Most of the government payment are done through online from MEseva and Eseva this helps to understand that government is using digital platform and in future india will become digital india.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Move to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupees to new one is good because of it people starting using digital payments and increasing cashless economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;SMART GRID VENDOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In this competitive environment , one has to adopt new techology and trends to capture market and gain competitive advantage over competitors, in same way vendors all over the world are brushing their techniques or updating their business while shaping smart grid vendor landscape and trying to lead the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; Firms are trying to get success.Many developed countries like North America,Europe and East Asia&amp;nbsp; markets are growing rapidly and excepting smart vendors so vendors are providing solutions through smart metering value chain and data analytics use multiple smart grid segments to enhance relationship between smart metering and distribution automation because if smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management are not in tune with each other smart grid cannot be done effectively. Some of developing countries are in initial stage in markets and vendors has just started smart grid projects.Counties like Africa,Latin America and South Asia vendors are trying to internationalise their firms so they are adopting Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape.Growth rate for these king of projects are increasing day by day.The ultimate goal of every firm is profits and customer satisfaction so when firm found that there is growth in smart grid project it is obvious they grab that project. Fragmented industry quickly shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. smart grid investment will reach&amp;nbsp; $380.1 billion&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; Brazil ,inspite of being one of the emerging country facing non-technical distribution losses and utilities will make immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments.government wants to replace electromechanical meters with smart meters. government announced an "opt-in" smart meter regulation for existing customers and made mandatory for new customers and replace 63 million smart meters with existing legacy meters.Northest group is predicting that brazil will not reach its target but some officials think that they will&amp;nbsp; reach their target. customers in brazil want to take advantage of smart grid and majority of the brazil have smart grid in homes . brazil&amp;nbsp; will lead the market and reach its target meet 63 million meters by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms. With high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors and smaller, more fragmented local players will help shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. This study takes a comprehensive look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positioning themselves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across all regions of the world, highlights growing regions and market segments, and assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions that are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries, smart grid investment will reach $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. This study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of the hundreds of vendors competing for this growing market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market &amp;ndash; An Insight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development. With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action. Like many emerging market countries, Brazil has high rates of non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also has a rapidly growing economy, which is beginning to strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it&amp;nbsp; set a non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However,&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; August&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2012, the&amp;nbsp; government&amp;nbsp; announced&amp;nbsp; an&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;opt--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;in&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meter&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; regulation&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; customers,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Paired with&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; requiring&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; new&amp;nbsp; customers.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp; was&amp;nbsp; not&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; anticipated&amp;nbsp; market&amp;nbsp; catalyst&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; those&amp;nbsp; expecting&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; binding&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; replace&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million existing legacy&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; result,&amp;nbsp; Northeast&amp;nbsp; Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its initial 63 million smart meter target. Yet, some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be achieved, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;With strong underlying economic and political conditions, it is inevitable that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade. The question is simply how fast deployments will take place. Through a combination of new meter installations, smart meters targeted at reducing non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt; technical losses, and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications, more than half of Brazilian homes will have smart meters by the end of the decade. However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
