&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pros of cashless ecoomy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;1. Time saving&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;2. No need of carrying physical form of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;3. Everywhere and Anytime it can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;4. 24/7 usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;5. Protection of cash being theft(Safety)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons of cashless economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Security issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If forgotten anywhere it can be theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Personal credentials may be used for unauthorised purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital payments are regarded as useful and time saving method. Many measures have been taken to keep the payments made online to be secured. Government is protecting the user`s information from being hacked and their personal credentials. Even though all thses measures are taken by the Banks, Governments and other payment service providers there are some who use the informtion and the payment transactions of the user`s in an unauthorised way which is indicating a bad sign for the user`s and stopping them from using these digital payaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mostly see youngsters and working people use cashless transactions and digital payments. This is because the old people think they are not secured due to some thefts happening around them regarding the digital cashless transactions. Awarness is to be created in the public that suitable measures are being taken to make the transactions and stop the frauds happening on these.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the country should be developed by creating awareness among people then only people mind set can be changed and the economy will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I conclude that digital payments must be made mores secured than now so that the opportunity can be grabbed by the people so that they can upgrade themselves as well as develop the economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As there is a significant rise in the population year by year and this may lead introduce many projects and which eventually has the demand for Smart Elevators. Smart Elevators need much technology consisting of some advanced features along with intelligent systems. Smart elevators are used in various places such as shopping malls, hospitals, residential (very few), etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart elevators have been developed more in the&amp;nbsp;Asian countries&amp;nbsp;of the world. And much awarness is not created in the our country. As we are also adopting technology and developing the country we also need the invention of Smart Elevators in few places were people often use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart elevators are desgined for high-rise buildings used for commercial purposes, hospitals, malls, movie theaters and even in big residentials. They reqire huge space, strong equipment and infrastructure along with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global vendors are also planning to develop them in undeveloped areas. There are many innovations done in creating Smart Elevator and importing new technology in it. Few of them are ThyssenKrupp,which gather the information and improve the service. In 2014, , Schindler elevator corporaation has instlled the modernization of its PORT technology at the Union Plaza office building, Pureto Rico. They are many buildings acroos the world which wasd designed by Schindler Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to the commercial use of the Smart Elevator , it has a growth in the overall market. The application areas of Smart Elevator are offices, healthcare centers, banks and other financial institutions , other retail purposes. The requirement for building Smart Elevators are&amp;nbsp;different for different places , such as the requirements for Residential and requirements for building it in malls , offices are different. They require large amounts of power and energy. And there are many other players in the market who provide the serivice with less power and with same customer satisfaction (Smart Elevators ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example for this Smart Elevator is Mitsubishi, wchch was deveoped by multi-elevator smart technology. The smartness of this technnology is that it cosumes maximum energy to extent to which it can during peak hours of rush and when there are only few people using the elevator it reduces its energy consumption to maximum. As the demand increases for this elevator systems in future it is expected to experience o good move in this by 2020.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
