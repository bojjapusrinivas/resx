Current global economic conditions are highly effected by the developing and emerging countries and to say that effect is very optimistic. The global economic conditions are very dependable and adaptive to the developing and emerging countries role and shows flexibility to the progress they achieve in day-to-day life. It is the progress of the developing and emerging countries which helps in reviving the current global economic conditions. Current global economic conditions are highly dependable on the developing and emerging countries in a high number of aspects. As the technology grows that technology is acquired and imbibed by the countries to make themselves &amp;nbsp;progressive through those techniques which gives them success and enable them to think new and achieve something greater than that. This is making the man to work towards his goals and aims and reach to greater and greater levels and this is how the countries are developing themselves and becoming a challenge to other countries. This process is leading to discovery of new and highly beneficial techniques which decreases our efforts in terms of getting results, it makes our work easy i.e., less time consuming result-oriented techniques. Through this large volumes of works are done in less span of time and achieving greater profits. Thus through technology imibibition, countries are developing, so this development in the countries plays a key role in reviving the current global economic conditions. Each and every contributes to the global economic condition, but it is the developing and emerging countries which contribute a lot to it. According to me, developing and emerging countries give a lot of scope to improve the current global economic conditions. As the country is developing, it is obvious that its economic condition is also developing which contributes to the global economic conditions. Developing and emerging countries role is the most important one which contributes to the global economic conditions. As the countries progress and develop it directly shows the impact on the current global economic conditions. Developing and emerging countries economic conditions are directly proportional to the global economic conditions thus shows a direct impact in current global economic conditions if there are any changes in the economic conditions of developing and emerging countries. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman, times" size="4"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Thus, I conclude that developing and emerging countries are higher than those of the developed, so they do show a great impact on the current global economic conditions either in a optimistic or pessimistic way.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
