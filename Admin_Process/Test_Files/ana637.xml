Do you think betting in IPL should be legalized to avoid recent match fixing scams? Elaborate with reasons&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethics in any field plays a vital role in every human being as it defines one&amp;#39;s honesty as well as one&amp;#39;s loyalty to one&amp;#39;s work, family and country/nation as a whole. Without ethics human beings will live as strayed animals and chaos shall never cease to exist. The term ethics is simply a set of moral values and rules that an individual is required to possess and live with in the modern society. In sports it can be termed as rules of the game, if not abided by the rules/ethics, one may land in serious trouble, adding the shame and guilt if the individual is playing for a national/international level. It is also the most basic principle that a coach teaches its students before beginning any kind of sports. Going against ethics is like cheating one&amp;#39;s own self and thereby repenting for the same later on. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;About IPL matches, I personally believe that the government should take immediate steps to ban all the IPL matches with immediate effect. Firstly, the politicians had been bleeding the country with the&amp;nbsp;hard earned money of the public along with corruption, now our beloved cricket players have started doing the same in a more fashioned and glamerous way. Truth is there is no end to greed and lust for money. And these players are filthy rich, no matter whatever punishment they may receive, they&amp;#39;ll always get away with their ever increasing bank accounts. Secondly, they already have tarnished the popularity and beauty of good cricket which had been built&amp;nbsp; by most cricketers in the past whereas the present generation of cricketers beleive in earning &amp;#39;quick money&amp;#39; even if they have to get their hands dirty and stoop to any extent imaginable. Personally I believe that it was just a matter of luck or a political event for the police to catch hold of the culprits as this has been going on for years now, and why all of a sudden make arrests out of the blue and divert the public&amp;#39;s attention from the multi-crore scams of the governent which would have an ever lasting string of riots fueled with anger and violence. Its rightly to say that the good people in the country are being out numbered by the bad people wherein everyone just fails to do anything good for even a certain period of time. Due to the recent events, even the most devout cricket lovers are loathing the fact that they used to love cricket so much and what to say about the cultprits who had in the recent years had joined the team. Even cheating in a game is almost acceptible but in the case of betting, its like the player is actually selling himself along with his country to the betters in-exchange for a few bags of paper notes. Banning the IPL matches would certainly help in curbing&amp;nbsp;the sick disease of lust for money to a great extent. Also the government should take corrective measures so that this does not beceome a trend for the future players who will join the team. The government may also take steps to keep an eye on all the cricketers who play in the IPL matches and also in the national and international matches which may prevent the players to commit such offences in future. Lastly, the IPL matches ought to be banned with immediate effect for the country&amp;#39;s sake and for the performance of up coming cricketers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
