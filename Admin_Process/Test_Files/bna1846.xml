&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In 2008 India is gaining strong domestic factors nd it is growing very fast form the crisis , it is expected that India to be more than US$ 5 trillion according to the current market price. As of &amp;nbsp;2010 , india economy size will be comparable to the Japanese economy in terms of GDP in US dollars . In certain time period , some of the developed economies and emergence of certain domestic issues are responsible for restraining India`s growth .It is expected that India`s economic growth during the current decade to be good in service sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is expected that investment activity to go ahead in the future that will help the Indian economy to have higher growth rate &amp;nbsp;and it is seen that shares of investment to Gross Domestic product to increase from 36.6% during FY10 to 40.7% during FY20. Investment helps in setting up an favourable policy environment that act as catalyst for the growth of Indian economy during the current years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;For the econimc growth, Infrastructure will be both a cause and consequence during the current decades. There is a sharp groth in domestic savings that will help in supporting the domestic investments where the saving rate is increased from 33.8% during FY10 to 39,5% during FY20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As &amp;nbsp;Compared to 60.0% during FY11 , the share of discretionary spending is expected to rise 70% of private final consumption expenditure under consumption in the current years which helps in the growth of Indian economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;They various economic growth drivers are&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; To achieve " inclusive growth " , investments in social and physical infrastructure is the key growth driver in the current decades. It is expected to amount for 3.8% of GDP by FY20 of an infrastructure investment in the elecricity sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; It is expected that investment in physical infrastructure leads to various factors like employment generation, increased production efficiency , reductioin in cost of doing business and standard of living is expected to drive the infrastructure investment from around 6.0%% (BE) of GDP in FY12 to 11.5% of GDP by FY20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Government focuses more on Healthcare facilities and it is expected to increase the total Government expenditure on Healthcare from 1.3%(BE) of GDP in FY12 to 2.2% of GDP in FY20. &amp;nbsp;And it is also expected that investment in agriculture sector to increase from 2.6% (BE) of GDP in FY12 to 3.2% of GDP by FY20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;It is observed that invesment in various sectors helps in the growth of the Indian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India Economic Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India remained remarkably resilient from the global economic turmoil in 2008 owing to its strong domestic fundamentals and had been one of the fastest economies to recover from the crisis. Currently, the growth momentum of the Indian economy has again been impacted. This time around besides the prevailing crisis in some of the developed economies, emergence of certain domestic issues had played a major role in restraining India&amp;rsquo;s growth momentum. However, we believe that India&amp;rsquo;s long term growth prospects will remain buoyant driven by its underlying strong macroeconomic fundamentals. We believe that emphasis on boosting investment activity and setting up of a favorable policy environment will act as a catalyst to unravel the growth potential of the Indian economy during the current decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The highlights of the analysis have been provided below &amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;We expect the current phase of subdued growth to continue till FY15 before the economy moves into a high growth phase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s economic growth during the current decade is expected to be driven by the buoyancy in the services sector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
