&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Cashless Economy in India&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Cashless economy is defined as the economy or the society in which financial transaction done without the&amp;nbsp;involvement of the physical cash that is currency notes or coins and the transaction is done through the online or digital payments methods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;As the world is going digital now-a-days the cashless economy is very important to India. The government is also taking the necessary steps to improve the cashless economy. The one of the step that the Government of India has taken is the Digital India. The cashless economy is the one of the part of the Digital India. Cashless economy is nothing but economy with no liquid cash. The cashless economy consists of the digital payments, card payments, online payments etc. In the country like India with high population and the majority of the population is middle class and lower middle class it is very difficult to establish the cashless economy.&amp;nbsp;There are pros as well as cons for the cashless economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Pros and Cons of Cashless Economy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;There are many advantages for the cashless economy.The one of the main advantage of the cashless economy is there will be trasparency in the spendings and the earnings and there will be no fraud and also there is no need of carrying the cash. And the another anvantage is the cashless economy reduces the paper work. The cashless economy saves the time and it very easy to handle. Through the cashless economy any person can send or recieve the money from any person from any part of the world. It is very easy to handle than the cash economy. Apart from the pros there are cons for the cashless economy. The one of the most important drawback of the cashless economy is the security. For the cash less economy there will be password , PIN or OTP. If the Personal Information is theft by the other person then it is the threat. We should be very careful while handling the cashless economy. The another one is lack of knowledge on the cashless economy to the people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Are digital payments Secure enough for the Indian economy to go cashless?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;According to my view the digital payments are secure enough for the Indian economy to go cashless because we can eradicate the corruption in India by these cashless economy as there will be record for each and every rupee that we spend or earn. But it is not an easy task to make a country like India totally into cashless economy due to its population and poverty. But if India overcome this problem in adoption of the cashless economy India will become the developed country soon. The government should take the necessary steps to educate the people about the digital payments and the people also want to help the &lt;span class="example1"&gt;government to reach its goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Growth of Smart Elevator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The market of the smart elevator is increasing globally day-by-day. Development of technologies of existing elevator systems is very speed and we can expect a radical shift by 2020. As the part of the modernization and the development in the developing asian countries, the deployments of smart elevatorscould takeover the modernization revenue by 2020. Only china adds the 53% ofhigh-rise projects in the whole world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;As the number of high-rise buildings are increasing fastly, they are demanding for the fast, comfortable, and secure elevator transportation system. In addition to this the worlwide green infrastructure standards are deploying the smart elevators in the new structures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The development of the traditional elevator systems in the countries like U.S., UK, Canada and France are contributing the major part in the Smart elevator revenue. The one of the main reason for the revenue of the smart elevators is the rise in the high-rise buildings and the modernization. The smart elevators contribuites the 52% of the revenue inthe overall modernization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The advanced technological developments in the smart elevators like intelligent communication, access control and security are using for the residential, commercial purposes. The smart elevators can be customized to unique requirements and can also provide good hygiene, comfort, space, reliability and destination control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;There is the rapid growth in the urban population. In 1960 there is 34% and where as in the 2014 there is 54% of urban population. It tells us that there is the 1.8% growth in every year. The limitation of the geographical expansion in the urban areas demands for the vertical growth that is high-rise buildings and this increases the demand for the smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;As a result the global vendors are currently focusing in the vertical transportation and that is smart elevators. ThyssenKrupp, which is the market leader which maintains and manages the 1.1 million elevators is now working on the smart elevators.In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the insytallation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at tha Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquaters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to improve the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators is boon to the overall market. The commercial applications where the smart elevators are used are offices, hotels, hospitals, towers and also mall ans multiplexes. the design and the performance changes with different industry or the diffferent purpose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in the klarge buildings and the market leaders are working on the less comsumption of energy and provide the same customer experience and they are called as the smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces the energy consumption by 10%. The smart technology focuses on the operational efficiency during the peak hours and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during non- peak hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
