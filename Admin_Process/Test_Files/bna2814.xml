&lt;p&gt;Usage of plastic is the most dangerous cause for the water and air pollution and it will become sin for next generations. Most commonly said pharse is &lt;span class="bold"&gt;"Save the Environment and it will Save you in return"&lt;/span&gt;. It is perfectly true. Usage of plastic is not confined to specific department or specific things. In our day to day activities only, we will use the plastics in almost all the works we do. We have other options where we can avoid plastics, but they are costly. So mostly people will tend to use the cheaper one. Sadest part is every one are aware of the side effects as well, but still people are not interested to stop using the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to take the required measures in order to overcome the usage of plastics. Government has to take the intiative to ban the plastic. Before proceeding to ban the plastic, government has to show the alternatives otherwise no will stop using the same. Banning of plastic will intrun effect the economy, inorder to avoid the same, it has to take certain preventive measures as well. If we do not take the right steps to control the plastics, infuture for sure we will have only polluted water and polluted air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Govenment has to take the initiative in promoting&amp;nbsp;alternatives for plastic usage like, cloth bags, jute bags and the plastic made of sugarcane (which is eco-friendly). Promoting campaigns to avoid the use of plastics. There are many initiatives to avoid the use of plastics. If the government took the right decisions, for sure it won`t effect the economy sector as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per my knowledge when it comes to the economy or environment we have to choose the environment. if we are defecit with economy, we can compensate with other sectors economy. Once the environment get spoiled which is next to impossible to get the same peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Passenger cars are haemorrhaging market share in Australia as sales of sport utility vehicles shatter records and the gap between the two segments shrinks to its smallest, propelled by the popularity of compact SUVs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Passenger cars still take up the larger share of Australia`s estimated $61 billion auto market. Sales were around 40,000 of the just over 90,000 vehicles sold last month, compared with 30,000 SUV sales. But with passenger car sales sliding 7.3 percent from a year earlier and SUV sales gaining 5.8 percent, the gap between the two shrank to its smallest, 10 years of data from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries shows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The spaciousness of small SUVs and their off-road capabilities compared to passenger cars helped boost their sales by 28 percent in the first five months of 2015 from a year earlier, compared with gains of 12 percent and 6 percent for medium and large SUVs, respectively. Bestsellers include the Holden Trax, Hyundai ix35 and Nissan Qashqai. Between 2000 and 2015, the number of SUV models sold in Australia more than doubled to 91 from 39, while the most popular segments of passenger car models only rose to 112 from around 85, according to Richard Johns, head of Australian Automotive Intelligence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The rise of the SUV in Australia is not unique. Sales have surged in China, the United States and Britain in recent years as the roar of a 4x4 and its better fuel economy and handling than ordinary cars became the calling cards of the SUV. In Australia, the soaring sales in compact SUVs are a bright spot for the autos market, which shrank 2 percent last year in a slowing Australian economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Title: Sales of sport utility vehicles shatter records in Australia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In Australia, according to the recent sales reports there is a rapid growth in the sales of compact sports utility vehicles (SUV`s) when compared to the passengers cars. The increase in the sport utility cars (SUV`s) is due to its widespace, comfortness and better fuel consumption when compared to the passenger cars. Though SUV`s are spacious; passenger cars are having their own uniqueness and mostly people will choose these cars when it comes to their budget. 10yr data reports from the Federal Chamber of automotive industies revelaed that the gap between the sales of passenger cars and the compact SUV`s is very less.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Recenet markets reports has reveled that there is a 28% increase in sales in the first two quarters itself when compared with the sales of medium and large SUV`s. Richard Johns, Head of Automotive Intelligence stated that from 2000-2015, the sale of different SUV`s is increased to 60%. Not only in Australia, SUV`s sales has been increased in China, USA and in Britian as well. The increase in the SUV sales are marked as important because of the 2% fall in the last year automotive industry/market which inturn effected the Australian economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
