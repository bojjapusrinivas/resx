Is disinvestment really good for India or is a rethink required? Please take a stand and elaborate.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Disinvestment means withdrawing your investment from a particular project or business venture. It means giving up the ownership of the stake that you have in a business. Indian government has been thinking about disinvesting for a few years and finally have announced the new disinvestment policy this year. The Indian government`s policy of disinvestment involves selling the stake in Public Sector Units (PSUs) to private individuals. It means moving from a socialistic economy to a capitalistic economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Every coin has two sides. Similarly, disinvestment has both advantages and disadvantages. The government cannot disinvest in each and every sector. Disinvestment should be done only in those sectors and units in which the private sector can excel. The mail advantage of giving ownership of PSUs to private individuals is that the private sector is more efficient in its operations. Eventually, it will lead to higher bottom line and top line. Profits will increase and the organization will have a better brand image. The disadvantage of disinvestment is that private individuals usually cannot take up ventures which require huge financial and managerial resources. Also, there are some sectors in which the Indian government should have complete control. If it disinvests in every sector, the government will lose on public revenue which will lead to fiscal deficit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Disinvestment can be good for the Indian economy. But it should be done only after taking into account the pros and cons. It should be done in those sectors where private individuals can do better that the public sector. In India, private sector has been outperforming the public sector in the financial and banking industry. Private banks like Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, etc. have been able to perform better than the government banks. Even in the construction industry, private Indian companies have excelled. The Indian government can also disinvest in electricity and natural gas sector.&amp;nbsp;Thus, it is a sensible choice to disinvest in these sectors. Also, empowering the private individuals will increase the confidence of the common people in the national government. On the other hand, we have seen the private sector fail as well . A few years ago, we saw disinvestment in the Aviation sector. Today, most of the private players in the aviation industry are running into losses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a concluding note, I would like to add that every policy will have its positives and negatives. We have to use them in such a way that it fulfills our objectives. We have to strike a balance and make sure that the positives are maximized and the negatives are minimized. It can be done only through careful thought and examination. Disinvestment is a good tool for the Indian government. It creates revenue for the government and empowers the common people. Yes, moving to a capitalistic economy by disinvestment can increase the performance of the Indian economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
