Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medical care is a very basic necessity of citizens. Every citizen has the right to avail&amp;nbsp; the medical care facilities.There are various facilities available in the hospitals in order to give the complete medical&amp;nbsp;assistance to a person who is sick. But the question is the medical care given to everyone? The medical services are commercialized and only the rich or the people with power are able to avail the services. The government hospitals do not have the appropriate facilities due to lack of funds because of which the poor do not have proper medical services. Even the doctors are not concerned about the health of the patients. The students who are pursuing the medical studies are interested in working in private hospitals beacuse of which there are not sufficient doctors available who can work in Government hospitals. The condition in rural areas is even more worse. There&amp;nbsp;are no hospitals in many&amp;nbsp;villages and if there is a hospital it has only one room where not many patients can be accomodated. The medicines are not available on time and there is no proper&amp;nbsp;disposal and sanitation system in place. The Government needs to take necessary steps in order to make sure that the medical benefits are provided to everyone. The commercialization of the medical services can be helpful but only if it is affordable to everyone. If the poor&amp;nbsp;cannot avail the services then there is no use of commercialization.&amp;nbsp;The Government has to initiate programs where the student and the doctors are trained to work in rural areas and the government should make sure that they have proper medical facilities available for the doctors to go to a place and work there. Investments shold be encourages in the rural areas and the services should be made available at a very affordable prices. The&amp;nbsp;availability of medicines and the ambulance services should be improvised. There are situations where patients die on their way to hospital because there is no emergency treatment given to them or the ambulances have not reached on time or due the lack of ambulance services. The ambulance should have atleast one doctor who is trained in handling emergency cases so that the risk factor can be reduced. The Government should make sure that there are ambulances available&amp;nbsp;in every place. The duty also lies in the&amp;nbsp;people&amp;nbsp;who&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;understand the value of life and help people in using the medical services which are available for them in the best possible way.&amp;nbsp;It is the duty of every citizen to extend a helping hand to those who are need of any medical care without thinking about themselves. Commercialization of the medical services is a good option as it also gives business opportunities to many people but it should be done such that it is affordable to all the people. If commercialization increases burden on the people and many of them are unable to utilize the services then there is no use of it. Government should make sure that the investments are utilized are done in the correct palces and the services are provided to everyone so that everyone can utilize the services and lead a healthy life. A healthy person can contribute a lot&amp;nbsp;for the growth of the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
