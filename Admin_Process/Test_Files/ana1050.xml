<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:30:18 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India being one of the largest populated countries across the world, has huge demand for health care facilities which play a vital role in the individual development as well as country&amp;#39;s development. As india is developing country we have to face many issues regarding healthcare facilities provided as they are not able to reach the demand.In many cases the government has failed to reach the basic expectations of people who are&amp;nbsp;in essential need of healthcare facilities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The major reason behind this situation is&amp;nbsp;the irresponsible behavior of government and&amp;nbsp;the departments allotted to undertake the responsibility of&amp;nbsp;providing healthcare facilities. All the age groups have an equal requirement of heath care facilities such as children, middle aged people and elder people, but the government of&amp;nbsp; India has failed to meet the demand. The medical facilities which are available&amp;nbsp;for some diseases&amp;nbsp;are sometimes&amp;nbsp;so expensive that even a middle class person cannot afford&amp;nbsp;it. This shows a greater impact on our people as well as our economy. In the recent years&amp;nbsp;people are being attacked by various&amp;nbsp;diseases which cannot be cured properly so&amp;nbsp;it is the government&amp;#39;s responsibility to provide medication to the&amp;nbsp;poor people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Government should establish medical and health care centers in every urban and rural area so that people living in rural areas will get proper medical facilities when required. Government should appoint efficient doctors to serve people and these healthcare centers should be monitored regularly and check whether workflow is&amp;nbsp;going in a proper direction. Specialized equipments and quality medicines should be supplied to the healthcare centers.&amp;nbsp;Government should provide sufficient funds to the health sector to achieve its goals. Govt. should also provide concession on the medical charges and&amp;nbsp;people should educated regarding the usage of medical facilities available to them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is not only government&amp;#39;s responsibility but also social responsibility to take care of these growing heath issues.As we know that &amp;quot;Prevention is better than cure&amp;quot; it is always a good act to keep our environment and surroundings neat and clean which will help us to maintain good health. People should educated regarding the usage of medical facilities available to them&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
