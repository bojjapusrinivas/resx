Because of economical undevelopment many of them in india are not able to develop.Education is the another problem in india, where many of them are illiterates because of high cost of study.Poverty is another problem, in india many of the people are living in poverty, it is increasing day by day. The children living in poverty are not able to study because of high cost of study, even though the government is providing free study, but the service is not implemented properly.Poor parenets also not intrested to send their children to school, instead they send them to work by which they can earn some money, by this child labour is also becoming high.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The major reason for illiteration, poverty, child labour and economic development is corruption. Corruption is the main problem facing in india since many years. All the problems in india are tied with corruption. Even though many laws and rules are implimented to eradicate corruption they are not succesfull, it is not only controlled by the government but also every citizen of india should fight against the corruption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I don&amp;#39;t say that india is not producing the intelligents, we are aslo having intelligents like abdul kalaam and some others, but according to our populatiopn we should have more enterpreneurs than any other country. But we are facing problems like corruption, poverty and many other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the major reasons why &amp;nbsp;india is not able to produce enterpreneurs like bill gates and steve jobs.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
