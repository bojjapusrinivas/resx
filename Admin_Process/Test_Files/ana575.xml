<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/18/2013 1:18:28 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does living in Big Cities offer benefits in comparison to rural areas? What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to answer this question by neither distancing myself from big cities nor rural areas.However, if a single point answer is demanded from my side, I would like to make living in big cities as the benefactor of the two.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I cannot state any economist or any influential writer who might have dominated my thought and making me arrive to such a conclusion.If thinkings of great leaders of India are still respected across India as a diversified nation, Mahatma Gandhi would have definitely disagreed over my answer.The graet man was a firm believer of the fact that India&amp;#39;s power is in her ruaral background and culture.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I am not going to delve in the merits or demerits&amp;nbsp;offered by urbanisation. I am thinking in the viewpoint of a sole bread earner of a very big Indian family.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Having mentioned by thinking perspective, I would like to illustrate it further. Due to the large economic disparity that exists between rural and urban areas, there has been a huge influx of rural people into urban areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Any change that is sudden catches the attention of one and all. A majority of India&amp;#39;s population is striving hard to earn a better living in Urban neighbourhood. Urban areas mainly support differnt MNCs from across the globe.A lot of talent and hard work has been put by India&amp;#39;s youth to attain a mark of their own, especially in MNCs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Such type of situation has arisen becuase naional policies have been created to encourage globalisation.We must focus our attention towards the rural areas. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;One bigh step in this front is the self employment of rural masses, especially the youths. Many Government schemes are already running to achieve their goals in this direction. But, most have been implemented on paper only. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Practical implementation is a very difficult process and takes a serious effort on the part of the Government.We know that a big industry can be set up oly in ruaral areas depending on the availability of free land. This should be win-win situation for both the industrialists and the rural folks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Time is ripe to pave our attention towards inclusive and result oriented growth.Empowerment of village panchayats is one such step to get a secure future for rural areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Agriculture is the backbone of India. We cannot create cities by destroying villages and lands meant for cultivation.Education of rural masses will ultimately benefit the urban areas. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We must embrace technology and make information available to farmers. A speedy growth of a nation is only possible by the equal co-operation of urban and rural areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is not wise to keep all your eggs in the same basket. We should realise that nurturing people only for urban activites will leave behind a great vaccum in the future of this country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
