<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/21/2014 10:40:38 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think that even with a population of over 1.2 billion, India has still not be able to produce entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India is still a developing country. We are not scarce when it comes to intellectual brains but&amp;nbsp;the problem according to me is we don&amp;#39;t have enough resources to work on. &lt;br /&gt;In current scenario the best example can be given of the new CEO of Microsoft Mr. Satya Madella belonging to Indian origin. Becoming a CEO of such a huge company like Microsoft is not an easy task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem I think is Indian people mindset. Whoever is highly educated&amp;nbsp;and willing to have a better lifestyle are not willing to stay in India and&amp;nbsp;continue with their work. They want to move away to developed countries like USA and built a better lifestyle, as India lack in infrastructure and other few facilities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With India itself having huge population,&amp;nbsp;today&amp;nbsp;we can find Indians in almost every part of the world&amp;nbsp;as well. They are living&amp;nbsp;better lifestyle and using their intelligence and improving in their work with proper availability of facilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even people like Bill Gates are scared of Indian Intelligence. According to him if he don&amp;#39;t keep hiring people from India in his business. India can itself&amp;nbsp;create an Indian Microsoft of its own. &lt;br /&gt;So according to me, India can&amp;nbsp;definitely discover&amp;nbsp;entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates&amp;nbsp;and produce highly popular and tech savvy&amp;nbsp;devices and software like Apple and Microsoft given the proper&amp;nbsp;resources and opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from this, there&amp;nbsp;can also be a possibility that being&amp;nbsp;intelligent Indians are little lazy towards&amp;nbsp;inventing something new. Instead they are choosing to work&amp;nbsp;on already existing ones&amp;nbsp;and serving&amp;nbsp;other countries. &lt;br /&gt;Another drawback I think we Indians are&amp;nbsp;having is fancy towards&amp;nbsp;International brand name. Even if someone trying to invent some Indian technology based product people here itself are not ready to accept it readily. Everyone prefers an IPhone over a reliance phone, the problem can be with its quality that comes from lack of resources. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Even then I think there are lot of people who&amp;nbsp;are working to invent something great in India as well &lt;br /&gt;We Indians definitely are not last in this race. For example,&amp;nbsp;we are having very young entrepreneur from age of 11 to 15 coming from Chennai who have their own business of mobile apps. If such people keep working in India and keep developing their products we can also have such entrepreneurs and such products which will be highly in demand in the entire world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not the matter of population of India, it is the proper mindset with proper resource even India can produce people like Steve Jobs, Bill gates or even Mark Zuckerburg. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
