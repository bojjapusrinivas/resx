<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/18/2013 10:28:30 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which sector, in your opinion, plays the most important role in driving the economic condition of a country? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know how much our country depends on&amp;nbsp;Mobile industry or&amp;nbsp;Mobile Technology. The reason behind is that everytime we need the assistance of technology for some or other thing. This&amp;nbsp;Mobile industry have hold on the market such that it is driving the economic conditions of the country. For example: We have build Ipad, Iphone&amp;#39;s to make a common man sick of the technology and because of which today every man doen&amp;#39;t wants to turnoff the technology. The growth and the development in this field has minimized human efforts but made them dependant of the technology. As the world has become crazy about the new products launched in our daily life with advance features nobody wants to compromise himself for the less featured things. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Today,when we are waiting for the new products to launch and the purchase of the same has&amp;nbsp;take the economic condition on high.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We can&amp;#39;t ignore what&amp;nbsp;Mobile industry has done for us. Whether you take mobile&amp;nbsp;application development or the some software development we are getting things from both hands. When&amp;nbsp;they find some lacking in their previous versions they come up with something new and exciting for the likers. However, at times we face critical downturns but still we can&amp;#39;t count them out in this race of competition. With the market research not only small&amp;nbsp;cellular companies big MNC&amp;#39;s have kept them in the hunt. There might&amp;nbsp;come numerous hazards in the path of&amp;nbsp;mobile industry but due to their focus on the market they are able to do what others are failing.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If the company is able to make proper adjustments with the demand and supply no issues would either stop them. For example: The&amp;nbsp;Mobile company is driving economic conditions only because they are known to their sellers and buyers. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is important to be in the competition in such competitive environment when others are failing to do they are steady in their approach and are mostly benefited by their market shares due to their popularity in the world market. It is the market research which can&amp;nbsp;keep any industry&amp;nbsp;alive in the competition of fiercs. With the&amp;nbsp;increase in the number of companies it has become really&amp;nbsp;tough for any upcoming firm to make their mark without publicising them. For this they need to&amp;nbsp;know the opinion of the consumers and build their products accordingly.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The reasons behind the huge demand is the madness of the youth for latest things. This crowd of young people are highly responsible for the generous growth in the supply of cellphones in the World of Mobile market. They are not just searching for the perfect cellphone having all features in it also they bound to make upgradations in the same as they are comparing their handsets with other cellular companies.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
