<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:32:57 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we all know India is a developing country.The healthcare system in india is growing upto the right speed but the gap is still there between supply and demand.The doctors and nurses are less in number when actually compared.The patients are increaing because government hospitals are not much in advanced technology as compared to private hospitals.In resources, maintainence government hospitals are lagging because the funds are not generated properly from government in time such that patients will be suffered but not doctors and their management.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India healthcare system plays a vital role.Especiallly government hospitals should be more cautious because many can&amp;#39;t afford luxious treatment. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The major step should be taken by the government is that raisinf more funds and implementing 24/7 ambulance service and also there should be one doctor and nurse in ambulance to give immediate treatment. The main role of healthcare system is to take care of patients and get them well treated.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As we see most of them opt for foreign treatment because their service and demand are equally balanced such that it effects Indain healthcare system. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The indain government should take safety measures and also should increase demand for experienced&amp;nbsp;doctors to treat their patients very effectively.The government should also increase the supply for proper medicines, as we hear in news due to improper medicare patients are dying. This is because no proper reponse from doctors as well as management. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There is a rule that first we should fill the form and then only patient will be admitted, the government should modify this rule because in emergency patient life is important but not the form. Some doctors are irresponsible towards their patients bacuse they need just&amp;nbsp;money and make profits,for this government should take strict action against them.&amp;nbsp;some important measures but not the steps should be taken care by the government is increasing proper service, demand for doctors, availability of proper resources, maintainence etc. should be implemented to improve healthcare system in India. Healthcare means taking care of paitients health in proper manner with complete responsibility and indian govenment should improve by implenting it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India healthcare system is becoming a business rather than life of a patient, they are just bother about their targets but not patients.It&amp;#39;s the government reponsibility to keep monitoring on such hospitals and take necessary actions also if not make them understand the importance of patients life but not money. This is one of major reason for increasing gap between service and demand. In recent news it was said that &amp;quot;India is polio free nation&amp;quot; it means it is developing healthcare system. Like this India should take important steps to overcame the gap between service and demand and also should understand the importance of patients life.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The important steps should be taken by the government&amp;nbsp;to reduce the gaps&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;24/7 ambulace facilty with doctor and nurse available&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;modifying old rules and regulations framed by healthcare syatem&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;increase in demand for doctors and resources like medicines availability&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;on-call availability of doctors&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;increase in maintaining good infrastructure and proper management.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If these steps are properly taken care by the government then the gap will surely reduce and patients will be satisfied by the treatment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
