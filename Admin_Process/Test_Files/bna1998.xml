List out and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Technology has drastically improved in this era and people are getting hitched to the technology which is a great boon and bane to the world.Work from home is an option which has been given to many of the employees and has improved the quality of work.The greatest benefit in working from home is less time consumption and employees are not forced to work in any of the stringent atmosphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;There are certain advantages as well as disadvantages in working from home.About the advantages,the first advantage is that the employees can save their time by working at home and they can even save their expenses in case they have to pay for the travelling expenses.In the policy of work from home,the employee need not continuously work for long hours,rather,he/she can take breaks whenever required.Another major advantage is that the employee will have the ability to think with much more patience and can give an efficient output which will be beneficial to the company.There will be less informal interactions if the employee works from home.The employee can save time for other personal activities which makes the life of the employee easier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The disadvantages with the policy of working from home is that the employees will not have any guidance from his collegaues or his team.The ability of team spirit will be lost and they may not do the work effectively.The employee will miss the office atmosphere.Another disadvantage is that the employee may take unnecessary breaks which may effect the quality of work.A cordial relationship with subordinates will be missing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;So,the policy of work from home can be beneficial if the employee uses it in the correct way and it may have a negative impact on the company if the employee misuses it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:SouthKorea2013EconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The economy of South Korea has improved as the economic indicators as well as the policy action has had a great impact on the growth aspect.Because of the strong improvement in the fields of construction,investment and exports,quarterly GDP growth rate improved in the year 2013.Even though the GDP growth rate has improved but the investement still remains weak.This scenario might change with the improvement of domestic consumer sentiment and the global trade cycle.But on the exports side,there might not be much improvement because of the Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Economic activity has become advantageous because of the continual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment.In April,The industrial production turned positive by an ampount of 1.7percent after two previous contractions.Similarly,purchasing managers index figures improved at a fast pace in the same month.In both domestic and foreign growth,the domestic`s extent of expansion was much higher which amounts for a domestic growth consumption in the secnd quarter because of its performance in 2013 and this view is supported by growing consumer sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In May,index went up to 104 from 102 which was in April and this figure matches the one-year high in March.With the improvement in ability of economic activity,consumption growth can be beneficial from low inflation and low unemployment.Both consumption as well as investment will gain advantage from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan and monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The South Korean parliament planned for a $4.8 billion plan to help small and medium enterprises and to improve worker incomes and to improve corporate investments and real estate sectors through tax incentives.The Government is expecting these measures to improve the GDP growth by 0.3percentage and create 40,000 jobs.The stimulus package suggested by the new government is a part of $15.4 billion supplementary budget and this budget would be funded entirely by new borrowing.Because of this,the fiscal policy is imagined to rise from 1.8 percent from 0.3 percent.As the public debt amounts to 36 percent of GDP,current surplus amounts to 3.8 percen to GDP and high total reserves includes $323 billion excluding gold,the deficit can be manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;With the monetary policy easing,this policy has been complemented and with the fall in inflation of 1.0percent year over yearin May and below the target rate of 2.5 to 3.5 percent,the BOK has planned to ease the policy rate by 25 basis points in the month of May to improve growth and to prevent the South Korean won`s sharp rise again Japanese currency yen.Within six months,the yen has fallen 20 percent against won making South Korea`s export competitive against Japan.The trend may change with BOK`s move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
