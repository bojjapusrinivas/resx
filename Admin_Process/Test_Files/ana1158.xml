<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:29:58 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; India being a developing country has many environmental factors which can lead to fall of Indian economy one of such factors are lower healthcare supply. This may vary with the areas such as urban and rural areas,as we know that rural areas people who are below poverty line may suffer from diseases which are caused due to malnutrition, spreading of harmful pesticides in cultivation of crops, contingent diseases and many other&amp;nbsp;unknown diseases are the outcome. Not only rural areas but also other areas in India are affected by these diseases. to deal with such inabilities government has introduced free medication camps at various places but instead it lacks in healthcare supply and demand. if the medication does not reach at time it may lead to loss of life. pharmaceutical companies should come forward to help such patients by providing medicines of low cost or free of cost. Though India is being developing country, it has to focus on healthcare of each and every individual by conducting surveys and&amp;nbsp;other research methodologies. By building hospitals convenient to the people and delivering medicines on time is the major factor to be considered by the Government.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;There was old age, medieval period, then&amp;nbsp;new age and now it is technological age.&amp;nbsp;This is the period where we resides in.&amp;nbsp;As a human being,&amp;nbsp;its a responsibility of us to stay fit towards health and wealth.&amp;nbsp;Government should take necessary action to prevent health hazards&amp;nbsp;either it could be due to intake of alcohol, tobacco or any&amp;nbsp;other pollution factors.&amp;nbsp;there are&amp;nbsp;various diseases even caused by the radiations&amp;nbsp;due to plantation of&amp;nbsp;signal catching&amp;nbsp;towers on the buildings, using excess of highly radiated equipment such as mobile phones, computers, etc.,. Government should analyse these factors influencing unknown diseases to the individuals and take necessary measures to lower the cause of such diseases. though diseases such as polio, cancer has medicines to&amp;nbsp;get prevented from loss of life but&amp;nbsp;only if it is known before hand that is in early stage of the cancer it can be&amp;nbsp;treated from the root. so, Government should arrange medical camps&amp;nbsp;free of cost to ensure the public health. as far as medication is needed the diseases has to be assessed and treated from the root of it. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Firstly, health hazard factors are needed to be assessed, it could be due to pesticides used in agriculture which ultimately involves in every individuals intake of food. Government should make necessary implementations to prevent the diseases from the core of it. Hospitalization is the major measure Government has to take in case of healthcare of people. proper medication need to be supply from other countries or others states which are rich in that.&amp;nbsp; In emergency, ambulances used by the hospitals should be efficient in arriving on time. Government should implement various schemes which can help poor people to take medication in the authorised hospitals. Government has to look forward for&amp;nbsp;a better life improvement in the country.&amp;nbsp;In&amp;nbsp;these days humans are being very conscious in earning money rather focussing on their health. Government should provide counselling&amp;nbsp; institutions in the areas where people can improve their health knowledge, as the life span of human beings is going on reducing. Government should take proper action towards patient care in the country, not only to Indians but also to the outsiders or foreigners should be treated well in hospitals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Government&amp;nbsp;should introduce hospitals in various areas to take care of infants, adults, old people. maternity hospitals for pregnant woman and so on. providing medicines on time to the poor people can save their lives. Pollution is another health hazard to people which can be prevented to some extent or completely by&amp;nbsp;implementing&amp;nbsp;the saying &amp;#39;clean and green&amp;#39;. there are other measures to improve the patient care such as providing them medicines, blood on time. This could be done by building blood banks convenient to the people and nearby hospitals. Doctors are the ones who gives life to the patient, Government should analyse the need of doctors in the hospitals. The&amp;nbsp; enormous gap between the demand and supply of the health care need to be filled and balanced by taking these measures by the Government.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Therefore, I&amp;nbsp;conclude that Government has to introduce&amp;nbsp; health&amp;nbsp;schemes&amp;nbsp;which can help people who lie under poverty line and&amp;nbsp;who suffer from disease. Licensed medicines&amp;nbsp;can be imported from the other countries to improvise healthcare of the country. proper medication on time to the patients is the important ailment the Government has to implement. the deficiency in vitamins is assessed by the medication and necessary medicines are provided on time to the patients. in this way, India can move towards a better healthy future in upcoming years.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
