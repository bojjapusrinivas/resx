What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In present generation there is a&amp;nbsp;lot of demand&amp;nbsp; for health care&amp;nbsp; due to changes in the life style&amp;nbsp;of &amp;nbsp;individuals, but there is no proper&amp;nbsp;availabilities which are required for&amp;nbsp;health care&amp;nbsp;sector .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; According to my opinion there is lot of gap in health care supply and demand especially in India&amp;nbsp;due to&amp;nbsp; some rules and regulations that as to be followed by&amp;nbsp;the government of India to increase the health care in India as&amp;nbsp; some&amp;nbsp;counties are adopting some rules to enter India still now.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; AS the living styles and purchasing power of individuals are increasing day by day in India&amp;nbsp;due to this reason &amp;nbsp;few countries are&amp;nbsp;showing interest to enter India as there is&amp;nbsp;a lot demand in health care as individuals in India are more concern&amp;nbsp; about their and their families life&amp;#39;s&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As there is no proper technical skills, standard skills that are required for the health&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;care&amp;nbsp;sector&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;fulfill&amp;nbsp;the requirements especially in India&amp;nbsp;which required to satisfy the individuals patients. Even the government of India is not focusing interest in health care sector where there is an tremendous increase in economic growth. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As per my opinion the government of India should follow certain rules to increase the health care in India like, firstly identify the areas where health care sector in important which is required to&amp;nbsp; protect the health the individuals who required it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Secondly use the latest technology where it can save the individuals life within the time&amp;nbsp; and their families and nextly&amp;nbsp;they should&amp;nbsp;focus on rural areas where there no proper facilities which required for basic needs still now&amp;nbsp;And this can done with the help of conducting camps in rural areas to know how important it is in one&amp;#39;s life.&amp;nbsp;Identify the skills&amp;nbsp;which are required for fulfilling the needs of patient health, this can done by giving proper training, motivation and on the job practice. The above mentioned rules can be done&amp;nbsp; by the government only after realising how important in one&amp;#39;s life and&amp;nbsp;how it increase&amp;nbsp;the economic growth this can be done with the help of other countries who are ready to enter India&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So&amp;nbsp; lastly &amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;want&amp;nbsp;to say that health care sector increases the individuals and their families desires and also protects their life&amp;#39;s and also increases the job oppurnities which changes the individuals fulfilments.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
