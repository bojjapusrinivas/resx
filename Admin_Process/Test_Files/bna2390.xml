&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Coming to the scenairo,What does India need Bullet train or Better Trains.At first we could like to know that Indian Railways generate a major revenue in the Indian economy.Indian railways is one of the largest provider of employement oppoturnities.Apart from that India is the 2nd largest(Approx 125 crores) populated country in the world next to china where most of the people choose railways has there means of transportation.Every year nearly 1.5 lakh crores of money is invested in the Indian Railways by the central government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Coming to the topic what does the India need either Bullet train or better trains can be discussed as most of the people in India choose railways has there means of transport, providing better trains is the primary objective with utmost satisfaction.In a country like India by having massive population providing Bullet trains doesn`t have a impact by neglecting middle class passengers.The cost of travelling in bullet trains is almost equal to cost of travelling in airways.In India people doesn`t get a sit reserved for them until and unless they book the tickets before 3 months,it means better trains are to be provided with adequate facilities.Better trains can be reffered has allottment of sits to passengers according to their conveince,trains should be maintained in a hygneic condition and the amenities like meals,power sockets,blankets should be provided.Trains should be on time to reach the destination.To do all these railways should be monitored all the time by the senior officials.Even today some of the areas in India are not connected to railways for these necessary actions are implemented to connect those areas to railways,within India railways play a major role in transporting of rawmaterials across the country,so amenities required by those rawmaterial transporting agencies &amp;nbsp;also should be taken into consideration.Every year approxmatiely 60,000 crores of revenue is generated from importing and exporting of goods through railways.Providing better trains in the sense refers to trains should be well connected to all the areas and they should be operated efficiently and effectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to the conclusion although providing better trains is the primary objective in a country like india but having Bullet trains too have a greater impact on the Indian economy why because in this fastpaced &amp;nbsp;technological growing environment having bullet trains reduce the time duration of the journey and makes us to reach our destination early.To comptetite with other countries in terms of technology,pocessing bullet trains will have a greater impact.Has of now some of the metro areas in India are not well connected with airways and to avoid this problem those areas should be well connected with bullet trains.Having bullet trains increases the reputation of the country among the other countries.Most of the European countries choose bullet trains for there means of transportation and they are well connected with it too.They travel miles of there journey in bullet trains to do there work.In India it is better to have a bullet train but apart from that first better trains should be provided by satisfying all the needs and wants of the passengers and after fulfilling the primary objective,government should focus on providing services through bullet trains at an affordable price.&lt;/p&gt;
