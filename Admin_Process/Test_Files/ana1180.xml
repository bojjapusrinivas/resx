<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:29:25 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes, I do agree that there is a gap between healthcare supply and demand because the first thing is&amp;nbsp; increasing in population.&amp;nbsp;well&amp;nbsp;India is having the highest number of population&amp;nbsp;as well increasing day by day,&amp;nbsp;in this manner the people who are mostly at the rural areas who have no proper capacity and facility to educate their children and no proper planning about family planning have more number of people in their families which leads&amp;nbsp;to imbalance in their care towards to their family members. Then due to this kind of imbalance they&amp;nbsp;leave their children over the streets mostly the girl children. so there will be no proper care taken by them which leads to many health problems.&lt;/font&gt;well if there is more population&amp;nbsp;simultaneously &amp;nbsp;the demand will be more not only in healthcare system but also in many other sectors. now a days doctors are discovering many new disseises which have no&amp;nbsp;cure. &amp;nbsp;coming to the healthcare system, there is no proper facility provided in many rural areas. the developed cities go on developing their own surroundings, they not even bothered what&amp;#39;s happening around them. the illiterate people who have no idea about health services provided by the government and many of them depend on their own treatments as per the olden days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;for this kind of demand&amp;nbsp;and supply chain &amp;nbsp;in my view the government should pass the rule that every developed city should under take&amp;nbsp;at least &amp;nbsp;2 or 3 villages to improve the condition over there. the government should implement healthcare campaigns to educate the people about how to improve&amp;nbsp;their health and&amp;nbsp;they must give proper idea of what are the problems that are effecting if they have no proper idea about healthcare.&amp;nbsp;they should conduct free healthcare services which gives proper awareness over the healthcare system. not only providing campaigns for some period of time and leaving&amp;nbsp;behind but also they must&amp;nbsp;built hospitals in every&amp;nbsp;place but&amp;nbsp;mostly in rural areas which can also give employment to&amp;nbsp;many people. they should treat every person equally apart of their status , cast, etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;every child should get proper education. even though the government is providing many schemas for educating the children, but due to the illiteracy of parents are not willing to send their children to educate. first the education system should improve in India, with that it automatically &amp;nbsp;improves in healthcare and also in other services.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
