Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In a country like India medical care seems to be a luxury for a lucky few. Though the need for a holistic medical care unit is in order, it becomes a gigantic task when a huge population is considered. As we consider the capital required to set up a medical unit and also the various type of ailments that may occur , the step of commercialization of the medical services seems like a better idea. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Though there might be many oppositions for such a view, the main reasons to commercialize care are, ease of access to facility, increase in research and development of health care sector and last but not the least more focus on preventive measures. A private medical care unit generating revenue, thinks about&amp;nbsp;expansion as its next step. The expansion of such a unit will lead to better reach of the facility to rural areas&amp;nbsp;where health care is mandatory.&amp;nbsp;Another benefit that the private unit may have is to perform better research and development&amp;nbsp;in its own labs to reduce cost to the patient.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In todays fast culture even medical care is also expected to take place in fast-pass&amp;eacute;. Thus a private company which is having a strong IT background may launch applications which may act as health check unit and also the patients database. The details of a patient like blood type , allergies and vaccinations can be readily available in this personal database. When a medical practitioner has access to&amp;nbsp;all this data the process of health check up can be made efficient and fast.&amp;nbsp;In case of an accident the doctor can save the patients life if he/she has the information about the allergies the patient has from a particular medicine like penicillin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercialization of medical services do has many benefits, but it comes with a darker side too. Private medical units which are not supervised can charge the patient more amount even though the cost to the patient might be less in government units. The company can also&amp;nbsp;perform unnecessary tests and give the patient false report to extract more money from them. Thus to stop such malpractices&amp;nbsp;"Public&amp;nbsp;private partnership"&amp;nbsp;should be established. The&amp;nbsp;medical care unit that is build should be created as a joint venture of private player and government.&amp;nbsp;The private partner with its better R&amp;amp;D labs and IT services will be able to provide faster, efficient and robust medical services and the government can see to it that the patient gets the adequate medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercialization of medical unit will help in&amp;nbsp; supporting the demographic of the country. As the medical&amp;nbsp; care requirement may occur for new born to senior citizen. The idea of setting up of speciality medical unit is not new, many private players already exist for example Vasan Eye-care, Narayana Hridayalay . Vasan eye care is a complete commercial unit that provides eye care to people who belong to middle class and above. The people who are below poverty line cannot access such a facility even for&amp;nbsp; basic requirement of eye check up. Narayan Hridayalay is also a medical unit but it takes money as donation from people who can pay and gives free medical aide to poor people. The Narayan Hridayalay has the Guinness book of world record for maximum number of heart operations done per day. Such a facility is needed all over the country so that every one can access it, but the location is only in Bangalore which makes it impossible for a heart patient from rural area to reach. Thus the above examples clearly show the need to encourage some private players and regulate other players so that they serve the masses rather than for complete commercial benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus to conclude it will be a better prospect of a country like India to have many health care and medical units. Which can be achieved by PPP and private units which are ethical. Commercialization thus is not only required to be done it is a necessity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
