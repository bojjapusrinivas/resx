<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/27/2015 5:11:49 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;In this present scenario usage of computers has increased alot. As there is lots of paper work, all the organisations adopt using computers in terms of reducing &amp;nbsp;the time and all in terms of minimising the &amp;nbsp;cost for using paper. Even the educational institutions takes the help of the computer for any kind of the tiny work to be done by them. By taking into consideration the work load gets reduced when compared to any other aspect and the employee also try to work more effectively. Handling the work over the computer is been made easier as the work which ever done can be stored easily &amp;nbsp;in the storage device of the computer easily and it can also be easily rectified.If the paper work in done more it would be difficult to handle the papers as we could misplace it and lose it. Now-a-days, the organisation or the school or the railway system or an areoplane as given above are more dependent on the computer or say the technology as it makes ther task easier for all the respective departments as mentioned and they can even communicate to anyone easily.Due to the competition in the world the dependence of the computers have been increased tremendously as it would be faster than anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;For, running a school the institution has to make advertisements and promotions in order to make it a reputative one amongst all and more attractive it has to take the help of the computer as they an print there advertisements on to the internet &amp;nbsp;and add different effects or designg it in such a impressive &amp;nbsp;manner so that the parents as well as the students get influenced by the advertisement and would look forward to join the school , the schools can even appoint the teacher`s through conducting the interviews online as it would the task more easy for them as well as the teacher's who are willing to enrol into the school. Schools can even &amp;nbsp;make their website for the candidates to approach them and join. This criteria can be achieved with the help of computer or the use of technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Railways is the most commonly used mode of transport as the cost is less and the railway station can use the computer in such a way that the customers do not have to carry all there ID proofs while travelling as it may be risky for them so, the authorities can make a website where it helps them to get all the information about the customer online and there is no confusion at all for both the parties. And with the help of the computer the customers can also use the computer to know their present situation that is whether the ticket is confirmed or pending. The dispaly whhich is outside of the office of railways station that is which train is going to come when, also helps the customer alot that is also done through the help of computers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Aeroplane, as we all know&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;that technology has got a drastic change in our lifestyles. So, has the aeroplane facility has got changes to our lifestyle.The computerised machines which have been placed to check the baggage of the passengers helps the authority alot by reducing the hand work.We can even book the tickets easily online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Yes, as asked above our lives are going to be more dependent on the computer in the future as the people want their work to be more accurate and effective they would tend to use more and more computers in the future and lastly, the technology has made it more easier for the people to communicate to anybody around the world. For, the current scenario the usage of social media has taken alot of advantage as we have, for an instance watsapp,facebook etc.., to communicate to our friends and family and share any kind of the file from one corner of the world to other and at the lower cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I agree to the statement that dependence on the computer is good for the overall developement of the organisation or any other field as -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1. It makes work easy and fast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2. It helps the organisation to grow fast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3. The usage of computer minimises &amp;nbsp;the cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;As mentioned in the passage above, the key factor for driving the auto sales in the U.S. is due to the strong pent up demand in the aging of the vehicles on the roads of U.S. which has the faliure in the unemployment &amp;nbsp;rate in the U.S. As mentioned the sales greww 13.4% in five year to 14.5 million vehicles in 2012. While, in May 2013, the sales grew uopto 8.5% to 1.44 million units and it has rise 10.9% to 15.3 million vehicles ob the basis of SAAR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auto industry outlook for Europe -June 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the passage above the present Eurozone fiancial crisis has affected adversely the operations of many global automakers, espacially the topmotor companies like GM MOTORS and FORD who has a lot of exposure to market. Car sales rate in the europe has lowed down due to the low ownig of the consumers confidence and the economy which is trigged by the loss to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordint to the European Automobile Manufactures Association i.e. (ACEA), car sales has been reduced down to 12.05 million units in 2012 and since the year 1995 thre was a decline in the demand for cars year-over-year by 8.2% as highly indebted banks have refused to finance &amp;nbsp;customers to buy new cars.This decline was steepest to trouble the Eurozone, where the sales of the cars reduced to 11.3% that was roughly coming to the figure of 9 million units. ( ACCORDING TO REUTERS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the automakers in the europe by that time were resorting to cut the jobs and palnts set up there because it was no longer easier for them to undertake full-flegged &amp;nbsp;operations in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unemployement reached in EU to 26.5 million in Mar 2013,while it increased upto 10.9% in the same month from 10.3% in march 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand ford plans to shut up the plant in U.k. and Beligium in the upcoming two years while, GM planned to suspend it Bochum plant in Germany in which 3,100 employees were working in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the other European automaker, Renault planned to retrench 7,500 jobs in France by 2016 &amp;nbsp;and Fiat and Peugeot has planned to eliminate 1,500 jobs. and among the Japanese automakers, Honda announced &amp;nbsp;to terminate 800 jobs at its South Martson plant near Swindon, i.e. southwest England in the second quater in the year 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Strong pent-up demand due to aging vehicles on the U.S. roads along with falling unemployment rate have been the key factors in driving the auto sales in the U.S. Average age of vehicles on U.S. roads increased to 11.3 years in January 2013 from 10.8 years in 2012. Banks were also friendlier as they offered greater access to loans with lower interest rates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% to the five-year high of 14.5 million vehicles in 2012.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Economic Crisis in Europe &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The present Eurozone financial crisis has adversely affected the operations of many global automakers, especially GM and Ford, who have a significant exposure to the market. Car sales in Europe continued to be low owing to weak consumer confidence on the back of a weak economy triggered by the crisis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;According to the European Automobile Manufacturers` Association (ACEA), car sales in Europe reached its lowest level of 12.05 million units in 2012 since 1995, indicating a year-over-year decline of 8.2% due to the sagging demand for cars, as highly indebted banks were reluctant to finance new car purchases for customers. The decline was the steepest in the highly troubled Eurozone, where car sales dipped 11.3% to roughly 9 million units, according to Reuters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Most of the major automakers in Europe are resorting to job cuts and plant closures, as it became no longer feasible for them to undertake full-fledged operations in the continent. Unemployment in the EU reached 26.5 million in Mar 2013, while the unemployment rate increased to 10.9% in the same month from 10.3% in Mar 2012. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the U.S. automakers, Ford plans to shut vehicle and component plants in the U.K. and Belgium in the next two years while General Motors would suspend car production at its Bochum plant in Germany -- which employs 3,100 workers -- in 2016. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
