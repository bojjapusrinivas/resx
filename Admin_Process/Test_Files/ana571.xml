<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/22/2013 2:17:17 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comment on the short &amp;amp; long term impact of free trade on economic development of developing countries such as India.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It has long been a truism that only free markets and unregulated commerce and trade can act as the elixir of life for failed or failing economies of the third world, despite the recent financial meltdown that cut many a Fortune 500 company&amp;nbsp;down to size. Experiments in self regulating markets have been tried and have shown a singular lack of self regulation, every single time they have been tried, whether it be the Great Economic Depression in the first quarter of the preceding century or the recent upheavel whose effects are still far from rippling out into obscurity.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is thus all the more ironic that despite there being clear and present advantages to economic conservatism, which saved the Indian economy from taking the full punishment of the global downturn, the idea that capitalism can be allowed free reign without consequence or care is still liberally bandied about by many a pundit. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In the closing quarter of the last century many Asian economies suffered the consequence of an excessive reliance on western markets. Low labor prices and a flooding of domestic currency created a bubble of cheerful ignorance that almost no one saw from the outside. Despite adequate warnings by several economists who had seen this all before and uttered warnings of the coming deluge, these &amp;#39;Tiger&amp;#39; economies spent vast amounts of human and industrial capital, often at the expense of building fundamental infrastructure and training its workforces to function as something more than (pardon the expression) glorified techno coolies. The price they payed was nearly two decades of stagnation and decay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As is often the case with the reactionary media, any call toward measured and structured growth is usually dismissed as &amp;#39;leftism&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;crypto-socialism&amp;#39;. What many of these self appointed protectors of popular opinion often neglect to mention is that the western economies, which we seek to emulate so fondly, became powerful precisely be cause they took the time and trouble of creating a society, and by extension, an economy, that placed great importance on individual initiative and education. It was only after the technological and social infrastructure had achieved critical mass that they were able to embark on the path to economic prosperity. Also, having wrested the initiative from the east, they have managed to maintain it for nearly a century now.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In India, and in many other underdeveloped South&amp;nbsp;Asian&amp;nbsp;societies, standards of education and technical knowhow remain woefully inadequate to deal with the realities of a &amp;#39;free market&amp;#39;. Having been brought up in&amp;nbsp; a closed license raj ridden economy, many industries still remain at a low level of technical capability. A simple example of how free markets are detrimental to the Indian economy is mentioned here; over half a century after independence, with arguably some of the best technical manpower on the planet our disposal, basic facilities such as sanitation and power are amost absurdly inadequate, because of this industries have to operate with enormous amounts of overhead, burdened by&amp;nbsp;multiple logistical chains&amp;nbsp;and their own independent sources of electric power, &amp;nbsp;Things taken for granted in the west half a century ago. Such handicaps cause large inertias to build up in every sector of the economy, all of which comes back to bite us in the form of missed export opportunities and failure to deliver. Protection at local levels is thus a distasteful but necessary requirement in order to maintain competitiveness on the global market.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;#39;Free trade&amp;#39; is a misnomer. Trade has always been a game of suppliers vs consumers,part of&amp;nbsp;what makes western economies so vibrant is because most major trends in consumer demand and services start in the west, then get shipped to us wholesale, along with a bastardized version of their culture.&amp;nbsp;While in the short term, the prospect of having a low cost labor market to cater to every western whim might seem atractive, the inevitable result of this misplaced optimism is that the more powerful economies will always dictate and dominate the terms of the transaction. Just as the economic downturn in the U.S.- a nation that at present&amp;nbsp;accounts for less than ten percent of the worlds population, was able to throw the entire world&amp;#39;s commerce into a near irrecoverable flat spin, any disturbance caused in the pool of western cosumer spending will build up into a tsunami by the time it reaches our shores. the reasons for this are painfully simple,&amp;nbsp;by neglecting our own markets and catering to their demands, we allow the opponent the luxury of initiative.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Free markets, long term and short term, can only function true to their stated intention of providing economic prosperity to all parties if the participating economies have achieved at least broad technological an social parity. In a world where an average American or West Europian teenager consumes more energy and resources than an entire third world family can access in a week, delusions of achieving greatness by fueling the insatiable appetite of the west&amp;nbsp;and catering to the percieved neverland of a free market will prevent us from ever siezing the initiative. The long term effects of a free market may not be debilitating and catastrophic, but it will keep us relegated to also rans on the international podium. The need of the hour is to build up our reserves of techonologial competence and innovation, so that we may reap the benefits of true economic salvation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
