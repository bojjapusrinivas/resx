<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:28:15 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India Is a democratic country. It is 7th largest country in the world but 2nd by population next to China and it is still continuing to grow even though drastic measures are taken by the government of the country.&amp;nbsp;Even though&amp;nbsp;their is a huge amount of growth in the field of health care and the supply is larger then that&amp;nbsp;to other developing countries it still fails to meet the demand of growing needs of healthcare facilities&amp;nbsp;or product.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The reasons for such failures can be attributed to many individual points such as&amp;nbsp;One of the major cause of failure is cost of health care, availability of healthcare, quality of healthcare, corruption in the sector and many other such factors.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Cost of the healthcare is high&amp;nbsp;due to&amp;nbsp;many factors such as increase in cost of research, increasing no of diseases etc.... but due to huge amount of&amp;nbsp;public where riches of the country are divided unevenly the people who&amp;nbsp;are able to afford the costs are less.&amp;nbsp;Though the government has taken many steps to subsidize, free health care plans like arogyasree they failed to meet the demands of the huge population.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Availability of healthcare, hear we can say that healthcare is isolated hugely to one place such as metropolitans, major cities of a state or a small no of towns&amp;nbsp;which&amp;nbsp;is basically&amp;nbsp;showing that there is no healthcare available&amp;nbsp;for everyone everywhere of the country. So health care doesn&amp;#39;t reach to all and doesn&amp;#39;t meet the demand.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Lastly other factors which may be minor factors like political benefits that is saying involvement of politics,&amp;nbsp;duplicating the products reducing the quality, facilities working for only benefits&amp;nbsp;etc.. also contribute to the meeting of demand.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This concludes that healthcare can only be met by addressing to above mentioned few factors and all other recognized factors for the failure of meeting the healthcare&amp;nbsp;demand.&amp;nbsp;Which can be only achieved by co-operation&amp;nbsp;of government, public and other individuals in&amp;nbsp;the sector. Like subsidizing the private health sector investments, providing more funds to the sector, paying&amp;nbsp;cess towards health similar to that of education,&amp;nbsp;producing quality products by implementing latest technology and many other such methods&amp;nbsp;by all we can eventually meet the&amp;nbsp;growing healthcare demand.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
