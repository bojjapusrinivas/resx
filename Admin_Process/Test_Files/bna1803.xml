&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
