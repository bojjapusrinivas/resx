<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;11/22/2016 9:40:42 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss the pros and cons of the Indian Government&amp;rsquo;s action plan for demonetization of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes. What would be the long term impact of this step on terror financing and creation of unaccounted wealth?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Demonitization is an impressive step by government to curb the corruption in the society. In a country like India most people would like to hold liquid cash for the expenses. But in many developed countries the concept of smart money has taken over the concept of liquid cash. Smart money is the paperless money invented by the developed countries in order to fight against the corruption, to bring down the unaccounted wealth drastically, and to curb the terror financing activities. Demonitization by government of India is a step towards acheiving such goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Every policy implemented will have pros and cons and demonitization policy is not and exception. But the positive side is that the pros of the policy are long term in nature where as cons are of short term in nature. Immediate cash crunch in the banks, long queues at the ATM machines, normal life getting hit, businesses getting dull revenues, weddings getting affected, are some of the short term cons of the policy. On the brigher side some of the long term pros include unaccounted wealth getting out into the society(by being taxed), no other option except to deposit or exchange cash in the banks, new bank accounts being opened, usage of payment wallets and cards(smart money and digitalization), financing of terror organizations getting hit(a source says that the naxalite groups in India has liquid cash holding of more than INR 7000 crores).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Government has created a havoc among the citizens by announcing such an important policy overnight(8th of November). Hoping that the output is expected to be postive in the long run, government has failed to meet the demand and supply balance which is an immediate effect. A study says the govermnet has been planning to implement the policy for more than six months. Has this been the case the government should have kept enough currency to meet the demand and supply balance. This proved to be costly as common people are hitting out at the government for such cash crunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;In the long term the policy of demonization, would send shivers among the terror organizations as they would be sitting upon large amounts of liquid cash which is now useless. The activities get halted, they are forced to surrender or hide as they would not have any cash left to buy the illegal weapons. The organizations&amp;nbsp;cannot be suppressed with such a policy alone. Countries should come together in bringing up such policies to hit out at the terrorist organizations. The creation of unccounted wealth would come down drastically as every one is forced to deposit or exchange the existing currencies. With the advent of smart and digital ways of payment every transaction would be monitored and taxed. The future of the country would thus prosper and flourish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Growing Demand for the smart elevator market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Smart elevators have become the part of the high rise rise buiulding everywhere. The growth in the size of the urban cities and population&amp;nbsp;is giving rise to the more number of high rise buildings. High rise buildings&amp;nbsp;always demand&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system giving rise to the need of&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;smart elevators. The market has been growing consistently. The concept of modernization has brought a drastic change to the existing conventional elevator systems in making them more smart to cater to the needs of the society. The world has been looking at the green infrastructure standards in every construction. This has given a boost to the market of smart elevators. In 2014, the urban population accounted for&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. Also estimates suggest that there would be a 1.8% growth in urban population every year between 2015-2020. An this growth would definitely woluld limit the geographical expansion to the vertical growth giving rise to ore number of high rise projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;eing technologically rich with advanced features such as i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;ntegration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. The customization being one of the unique features of the smart elevators is more attractive and increasing the demand for it. It&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Smart elevators and high rise buildings market share&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world. This clearly suggests how good is the market share for the smart elevators in China. Apart from China, U.S, UK,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. But, the recent growth in the high rise buildings would require new deplyment of smart elevators and this would surpass modernization segment revnue&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Major market Players and their developments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;ThyssenKrupp,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;Schindler Elevator Corporation,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;Mitsubishi are some of the well established players in the elevators market. All these are shifting thier focus towards improving more sophisticated, efficient and reliable smart elevators to remain competitive in the market and cater to the needs of the many high rise projects around the worls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;ThyssenKrupp, which maintains 1.1 million elvators around the world has integrated cloud capabilities to its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;systems,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system to its existing systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Commercial applications of the smart elevators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;The unique feature of customization of the smart elevators has&amp;nbsp;proved to be boon for the commercial application of the elevators. With such customization it can cater to the end user requirements as required differently by different users. For example&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers, in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Thus the elvators are designed so as to serve the purpose of the end user. Elevators consume large energy at commercial buildings and key players in the market are focusing on to bring energy efficient elevators to serve the purpose and Mitsubishi has developed one such elevator to focus on operational efficiencies and energy reductions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
