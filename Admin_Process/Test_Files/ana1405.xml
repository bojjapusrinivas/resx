<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;3/26/2014 10:49:23 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under Indian parliamentary democracy, is it possible to ensure balanced regional development? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;India got its independence in 1947. From that time onward India is in developing stage only. In India people of different religion stay and we believe that India is a democratic country. In India still&amp;nbsp;racial&amp;nbsp;discrimination&amp;nbsp;is there. people are being humiliated due to the caste belief.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India different regions are there which development is required. When the time of election comes all the politician will give an assurance that they will concentrate&amp;nbsp;on development of all regions. But this will be till they get votes. The politician themselves only divide the region mostly they will focus&amp;nbsp;on the place from where they come and some of them will jump into corruption they will do corruption for their personal development. When the time of election comes the politician will visit all the rural places and will give assurance to the village people for development of their region to gain votes. In fact politicians buy votes by bribing people.&amp;nbsp;It is just to say that India is a democratic country but in real corruption is more in India compared to other parts of the World. Indian citizens are also value more for money than anything else. In a country like India it is very easy for the politicians to neglect their work. If we want India to be developed we the citizens need to wake up and make the politicians aware that we are not fools over here.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;When elections are being conducted if we get a option of none of the above it would be a better option. If we the citizens&amp;nbsp;have the option we can vote for this option and the politician will get to know that people in India are not fools.&amp;nbsp;The present scenario of India is like we&amp;nbsp;have the highest population. The youth is not being properly trained and&amp;nbsp;the inflation rate is at peak. So now its the high time for us to wake up and think for our country. In India we need to have a regional development as in India most of the region are there where children don&amp;#39;t have a proper education and even there are some places where electricity is not there. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;When we see regional development, regions like Bihar are under developed. The metros are only getting developed day by day. With the Indian political system it can never have a balanced development. In our Indian constitution it is mentioned that Indian Government is for the people, by the people and of the people which means that the Government is created by the people for them and it belongs to them which will work for the citizens. But the politician work for their development not for the development of people and the place where they stay. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is not that India doesn&amp;#39;t have sufficient funds to have a balanced regional development but the unbalanced situation is due to corruption. Politicians support corruption. Scams are also there where people do all such sort of things to gain money. What matters for people is money. They only see hoe they can get money. No one is thinking of the country. When it comes to the Delhi Case the girl was daughter of an ordinary person who is a citizen of India but if the girl would be daughter of some politician or a richest person whoever is there in India the case would never close there. The persons involved in that case would have been hanged till death. Here comes the difference which is being bought due to money and power.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Politicians never work for the people they only know that they need votes which will help them to gain money. Once the election is over they forget that why people have voted them what is their duty.&amp;nbsp;It is not that only due to politicians development is not possible it is responsibility of the citizens of India also to work for their nation. People are also having a lay back attitude&amp;nbsp;due to which they are not able to contribute to the nation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So it is the responsibility of both citizens and&amp;nbsp;the Government also to work for the nation and its development.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
