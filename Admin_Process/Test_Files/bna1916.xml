List out and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Title: Technology advancements in office and work culture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Technology advancement is the present developing work policy. According to the present senario the technology has be growing simultaneously and it has been a well advanced option in the current world.Here we are going to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the changing policies provide people with an option to work from home, rather than the office where they met the team face to face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;According to me as the coin has two sides to it similarly there are both positive and negative for the advancement of technology. In my point of view work from home and face to face interactions both are usefull for the current world because, in some situations like meetings, solving problems, knowing some isssues etc we have to interact with the people definitely and in some particular need we can take help of our friends, and in some situations like emergency work we can do it from home it may save time from the traffic and also helps us to concentrate more on the work and it helps us to contribute our work presence in some functional time and emergency time at homes. This can be of two ways ie., every person will have their own views they can follow according to that and We can judge this by collecting some information from the people who are working in offices and can analyse the advantages and disadvantages of advance technology in offices. We can analyse this in some facts and figures by doing some analysis, by collecting data like primary and secondary data from the people this can be done by the following process like identifying the problems of the situation next analyse the problems next we have to collect the data and then analyse the data at last we have to conclude it by giving some conclusion or by giving some report. As discussed above we have both advantages and disadvantages for the technological advancements like,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Advantages:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;1. We can save time in the traffic and journey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;2. More work can be done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;3. Can balance the life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;4. Can work for some time when they are in leave, function or in journey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;5. No tension that they will reach in time or not so that they can concentrate on the work they are doing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;1. There may be deviations from the family members in the home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;2. People may feel lazy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;3. Proper information cannot be passed like face to face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;4. &amp;nbsp;If there are any doubts in the work it takes more time to clear it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;5. There will be disturbances in the atmosphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;6. Negligence of work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;According to me the conclusion is we have to change ourself simultaneously with the technology it take us to the greater heights and makes our work easy and effectively. It completely depends on the work and situation. Changing and advancing the technology is pretty good and useful in some situations and it may effect our work culture in some situations so, following according to needs wants and situation is better and it can be analysed by doing some research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Technological advancements and ever changing work policies provide people with an option to work from home is preferable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;option for the offices and people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
