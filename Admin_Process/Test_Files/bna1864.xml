Do you think this brain drain is making the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer? Discuss the pros and cons of brain drain, and measures to check this phenomenon? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Today, most of the students qualifying their studies in home countries i.e; developing countries and working for other countries i.e; foreign countries because to earn huge amount of money.So, efficient people are decreasing to work in the developing countries.It is difficult to run the business or companies without the efficient persons because of the reason the new opportunities are missing.The developing countries have less opportunities to construt new industries so there is an increase in unemployment.Monetary policy and fiscal policies are also very weak in developing countries.Even the technology providing is very low.Inflation and tax rates are more.The government facilities are less for the poor people. The foreign countries assumption that they can get the cheap labour or low cost employees in the developing countries.They are also giving opportunities like earn while learning.For some people working in abroad is a prestigious thing for them.As the efficient people are working for the developed countries they are becoming more rich by getting more opportunities and because of unefficient people more in developing countries they are becoming further poor.For example,most of the developing countries people like indians are working for the developed countries like United States of America.They work for the cheap labour.The developed countries are also getting the huge investment and providing employment opportunities.Because of it,their GDP growth rate is increasing.If it is a goal of the person to work in particular area then he/she can go ahead.In developing countries, the developed countries are constructing business and providing employment opportunities for the developing countries people.This makes them to earn huge profits by giving low salary.The developed countries export businesses will also grow rapidly.Recently,Narendra modi have invited the other countries people to invest in our country so that employment opportunities will increase and that reflects to the growth of our economy.The US president Obama also invited our country to develop by giving suggestions but the news I heared that he visited to gain votes from the people for electing once again as the president because most of them are our country people working there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:SouthKorea2013EconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Southkorea GDP rate is drastically increasing and it is twice higher in the first quarter of 2013.It has increased because of focusing more on the fields like construction,investment and exports.They have provided jobs for unemployment to work for low salaries and also taking care of the inflation rates.THey benefited by giving the true wages.Even though the 2013 quarterly results are very good, there investment oppourtunities had not increased.As the globilisation came into existence it reaches high and effects the other countries economy like Eurozone,China etc. Later, they have strengthen the industrial and consumer spending.As we know that satisfying the customers needs or wants by the manufacturing goods/services is the main goal of every company to get success.They focused on it and acheived positive production growth as 1.7 percent year over year.The orders have been increased,new opportunities and exports also grown.All these activities are supported by the Bank of Korea`s(BOK`s).The indes also moved from 102 in April to 104 May.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The main reason for the growth of Sounthkorea is the better fiscal,monetary policies and also consumption,investment opportunities.In May, The government has provided a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to encourage the small and medium scale industries for increasing employment opprotunities which increases the GDP rate,helping to invest and providing incentives working for the real estate sector.Statistically,GDP rate increased by 0.3 percentage points and provided employment for 40,000 jobs.The government also provided the supplementary budget to raise the growth rate to 1.8 percentagehey have taken care of deficit with the help of current account surplus and high total reserves.BOK supported by giving 25 basis points in May to raise the growth rate and to increase the exchange rate of won, within the six months the Japanese yen had fallen to more than 20 percent against the yen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;To increase the GDP rate,they focused on providing employment opportunities. If the planning is well then we can success in any aspects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
