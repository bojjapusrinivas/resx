What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; Health care&amp;nbsp;plays a predominant role.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Health care refers to the care taken for the patients. basically health care determines the main stream of hospitals, hospital Ambience, reception, their staff and facilities provided,billing, advices and guidances, room facility, security and basic amenities with minimum neat cafeteria and canteen facilities etc.,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Basically in India&amp;nbsp; most of the hospitals offers these facilities but with varied fees structure which can&amp;#39;t be&amp;nbsp;bared by the most of the middle class families. previously in olden days hospitals are with minimum facilities&amp;nbsp;are used to offered.but day by day&amp;nbsp;with the upgradation of technology,expansion and innovative methods are coming into progress and with new-new facilities which brings most of the people attention towards&amp;nbsp;those types of hospitals to opt&amp;nbsp;among the various hospitals.mainly people are getting attracted towards&amp;nbsp;ambience,reception, their staff and facilities provided,billing, advices and guidances,room facility,security and basic amenities with minimum neat and cafeteria and canteen facilities. In India even companies are offering many insurance facilities,medi-claim facilities,maternal for may be 3 months&amp;nbsp;and paternal&amp;nbsp; for one month ,leave,sick leave facility. even companies are offering many employee benefits such as disability income facility,insurance facility,and even on behalf of the companies employees can claim money and they can get discounts.even employees can get benefitted even after retirement.after retirement they can get monthly medicines,and even checkups .According to Economics as the Demand increases, Supply increases.but in Health care&amp;nbsp;services&amp;nbsp;their is an enormous gap between Health care Supply and Demand,especially in India.in many of the other countries offer many medi-claim facilities and their main focus is on providing enormous benefits to patients where they can acquire full satisfaction and feel friendly approach.so, that they can expose to get cleared to many of their doubts,and can get willingly to come again and again.Health care&amp;nbsp;plays a predominant role.But in India, even though&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;health care supply is increasing the demand is not in the same pace.I think government has to take some particular steps to transform and to enhance,build,expand health care facilities.so that &amp;nbsp;it can lead to reduce the gap between the health care supply and demand.
