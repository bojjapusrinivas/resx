<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/28/2014 4:16:55 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering the present state of Indian economy, outline five key agendas for the newly formed Central Government.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prominent &amp;nbsp;problems India is now facing is unemployment and &amp;nbsp;poverty.&amp;nbsp;In fact these two are interlinked with each other. The government should focus on employment, education , infrastructure, corruption, health and progress. I would like to suggest&amp;nbsp; few key agendas for the sake of good governance&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Encourage entrepreneurs : As entrepreneurs plays a prominent role in the growth of GDP, which enhances the growth of economy. The government should encourage entrepreneurs by providing them facilities and world class infrastructure. The government should encourage both small scale and large scale industries for the development of economy and to enhance standard of living of the people. Encouraging entrepreneurs directly influence the increase in employment. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Education : The government should be able to provide education for every individual. After al education is the right of every citizen. It&amp;nbsp;is shame that the&amp;nbsp;literacy rate of India is just 70%.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Every Indian should able to get primary education. Apart from that government should also focus on National institutions which have high morale and challenging education. Build more national level institutions&amp;nbsp;provided with&amp;nbsp;high technology &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Agricultural Development : The government should adopt technologies in order to get high yields on agriculture. India is rich in heritage but poor in technology. with the maximum utilization of resources and technology &amp;nbsp;the farmer should able get more yieldings on crop. I call India a developed country when the Indian farmer is happy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Increase employment : The only option to over come poverty is providing job opportunities. Government should be able to provide opportunities to its citizens. Every capable citizen should be employed. The government should maintain amicable relations with multi national companies only then the companies will come to India and more people will be employed. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Elimination of poverty : Nearly 40% of Indian population lives under below poverty line. The government should focus on providing the minimal needs for every citizen who are living in below poverty line. The main object of the government is to identify the people who actually comes under BPL and provide them the basic needs through different schemes &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Development of science and technology&amp;nbsp;: Although India is not a developed country the people over here are intelligent. There intelligence&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is none the less to foreign people. The only thing government must do is provide them with good facilities and they will make wonders. The government should focus on various fields like science and research which increases India&amp;#39;s pride and integrity &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Elimination of corruption : India is in top 10 at the rank of highly corrupted countries. It is of no surprise. Even highly developed country like United states is facing this problem. Instead of focusing on bringing back the black money focus on eliminating or reducing corruption. acts and amendments should bring for the elimination of corruption. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Final word : The government should govern people for the sake of people and not for the sake of building their own wealth. should improve the standard of living of each and every individual by enhancing economic growth. should focus on key areas like Poverty , employment, hunger , Education, health. the government should have vivid objectives and goals&amp;nbsp;and through a strategy and structure it should accomplish its goals. India needs a visionary leader who works on a mission of overall development of India&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
