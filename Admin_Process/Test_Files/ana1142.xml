<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:32:04 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Yes, there is a gap between healthcare supply and demand in India. There is a huge demand for the health care, which one would prefer to have in every walk of life. Since, being humans, one would require a health care for him/her. Healthcare is one such unit in which one cannot take it into a business perspective to attain profits. This particular unit of healthcare demand and supply cannot b taken according to the law of economics for demand and supply.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;STEPS TO BE TAKEN:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Firstly government of India must see to it what are the main issues involved in the health care service that are been faced by a common man.&amp;nbsp;Government&amp;nbsp;must start from the scratch to know about the issues of health care when the demand for it is to&amp;nbsp;given in a every possible way. They must start with these questions:- 5W&amp;#39;s and 1H&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The four W&amp;#39;s are-Why, Where, When, Who, What and &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;One H-How.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The question could b as stated :-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;-Why is the gap between the supply and demand ?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;-Where the problem is actually faced?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;-When is demand and supply gap is more?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;-Who is facing the problem depending on the class (i.e. Lower or middle or upper)?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;-What precaution&amp;#39;s must be taken to give the service in a effective way?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;-How it has to be done?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If Government gets the proper answers for the above Queries, then to maximum extent the&amp;nbsp;problem can be solved and the gap to certain extent can b minimises. It Is not so that it would b nullified in the very beginning. Since&amp;nbsp;as there are two sides of a coin, it is the duty of government to give it maximum support and it is also duty of the person who is in need of it to utilise in an efficient way. There&amp;nbsp;must b relativity kind of thing between the two.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is not that government is not providing good health care service.&amp;nbsp;There are many people who have been utilising it in a better way whenever there is need . But, there are people who are not aware of the various services that are been laid down by government for its public.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Patients who are admitted in the hospitals do not get the daily needs which are needed the most. Since the perception of&amp;nbsp;one would matter a lot. The management in the hospitals give less importance to few people who undertake government services. They are not been guided about to procedure. There is negligence which can been seen in the management. This may be because of n &amp;#39;n&amp;#39; number of reasons. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government must take steps in such a way that every individual is aware of the&amp;nbsp;service&amp;nbsp;which is existing. Since most of them are not even known of the list of services which can be used. They come up with there own suggestions and end up with an argument.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The most important thing is, wherever this services are present, the concerned authorities are not giving proper information on what has to be done to get those services. There are many loop holes in management where one has to be concerned about.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Conlusion : PROPER PLANNING PREVENTS POOR PERFORMANCE.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
