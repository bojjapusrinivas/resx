What according to you are the key contributions of Education in Modern Society? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;Education can Change the world&amp;quot;, yes I strongly agree with this statement. According you my opinion every thing in life is based on only Education. If you have education, you can change your world as your wish. Education is very important to everybody&amp;#39;s life to get anything in their life and their existence in the society.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;&amp;quot;Education can change the world&amp;quot;. Everybody have their won wish in their life For example i will be a doctor, i will be an engineer, etc., these all wishes are possible only when they are educated. If you have education, you can go anywhere and can do anything, because you know what is wrong and what is right, what to do and what not to do. Uneducated people don&amp;#39;t know that how to behave in the society by not disturbing other&amp;#39;s freedom, they do only what they think in their mind. &amp;quot;Education can change the world&amp;quot;, for example every one knows that India is developing country. If all of the people have educated, then India will become a developed country, because each and everything is only based on education. Education is not stolen by anyone, its a continuous process to develop your knowledge and improve your skill, your existence in the society In the present society you can get identification by other people with your knowledge and education.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="font-size: small; white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;Finally I want to say that,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;W&lt;font size="2"&gt;e face many attacks by terrorists, its only because of illiterate people and moneyproblems only&lt;/font&gt;. &lt;font size="2"&gt;So Government have to take the responsibility of this by providing free education to poor people. Because &amp;quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;Education can change the world&amp;quot;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;Education can stop the unethical things. Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;es&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;If you have education you can get the confidence in your life and deffinitely you will reach your goal. Your confidence and your education will change your world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
