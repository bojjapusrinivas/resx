Firstly we will discuss about the successful journey of Narendra modi. Gujarat was an dry state where 62% of land was covered with&amp;nbsp;desert&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;due to this&amp;nbsp; no proper agriculture lands, water facilities&amp;nbsp;was developed but from past 10 years face of Gujarat&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;changed. It should in first place for exporting vegetables, tourism, industrial belt and 24/7 electricity.&amp;nbsp;This is all because of Narendra modi. he doesn&amp;#39;t neglected any one&amp;nbsp;sector&amp;nbsp;and concentrated in particular sector.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider an example of 1990&amp;#39;s when Indian was in horrible&amp;nbsp; situation&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;their&amp;nbsp;was no currency for running the&amp;nbsp;nation&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;even&amp;nbsp;for one day. In this situation prime minister P.v Narishma Rao was taken an wise decision and borrowed money from different foreign banks with an agreement made to&amp;nbsp;them. capital which was brought from banks was distributed to different sector people with low interest and paying back the money within certain period of time. This helped the different sectors to run in successful and in turn helped the country for withstand economically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now,&amp;nbsp;In&amp;nbsp;Past situation Indian economy rupee&amp;nbsp; value was declining day-by-day where the present government failed in taking necessary steps. But when Narendra Modi was elected has prime minister initial day itself the stock exchange&amp;nbsp; rates was increased and &amp;nbsp;there was change in bullion market the price of gold was increased without reaching to&amp;nbsp; common man but now it was coming done with removal of tax about 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Imports and exports&amp;nbsp;tax rates should be decreased&amp;nbsp;for large amount of transactions. Educational&amp;nbsp;system&amp;nbsp;and unemployment&amp;nbsp;should be stabilzed has in the foreign country their should not be private schools for children only government school should&amp;nbsp; school&amp;nbsp;setup&amp;nbsp; with good standards and children after completion of intermediate for further studies should be earned by them. so, that employment rate can be increased. scams of many privates schools can be abolished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acts for women welfare should be created for freedom of girls and women&amp;#39;s in the society. This helps to build the trust among the people towards the government with in turns projects the positive impact towards foreign counties for investing&amp;nbsp; capital/ visiting India. this for build&amp;nbsp;or provide some foundation for Indian economy&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering of FDP into the country this shows both the positive and as well as negative impact.&amp;nbsp;Positive impacts shows the investing of huge capitals and providing employment to the Indian citizens but it shows great&amp;nbsp;effect on small and medium scale business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;All these&amp;nbsp; agendas should be consider for building a good nation is not all about single person it&amp;nbsp;it is responsibility of each and every citizen. when every one&amp;nbsp;think this is our nation and starve for it automatically it develops in all aspects. Then &amp;nbsp;American citizen should&amp;nbsp;be in queue to get visa for&amp;nbsp; working in Indian company and students for studying in Indian Universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
