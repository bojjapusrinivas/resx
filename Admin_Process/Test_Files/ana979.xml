Discuss with example &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In the present scenario, the modern inventions&amp;nbsp;play a major role in our daily lives. Because of these modern inventions our lives &amp;nbsp;became simpler as well as dangerous. For example, the usage of mobile phones shows their influence very effectively, as we know that the&amp;nbsp;invention of&amp;nbsp;smart phones brought a revolutionary change in our daily lives. Discussing about the simpler ways, we can use our mobile phones in many ways like finding the exact locations using the maps, money transactions, tracking the locations, finding what ever we want by &amp;nbsp;using the different applications etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The dangerous part of these mobile phones is, the usage of mobile phones may cause severe damage in many ways. Now a days the people were habituated to listening music through headsets which damage our hearing, the frequencies of smart phones are very high which effects our brain, the radio waves which evolve from the mobiles while we make or attend a call may cause harm to our brain and other parts etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not only the mobile phones, but people are also habituated to other inventions which are making the lives more complicated. The inventions like micro-wave ovens, escalaters, electric rice cookers, instant coffee vending machines and many more. These type of inventions made our lives easier which in turn made our lives complicated as we habituated to them very strongly in our day to day life. For example, micro wave ovens are used for&amp;nbsp;baking or heating the food, but the&amp;nbsp;micro waves add high calories to any type of food which is harmful to our health.&amp;nbsp;The situation became like, there is no man if there is no technology. In such a way the technology and new inventions were connected to our lives.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Although our lives are in&amp;nbsp; complicated and&amp;nbsp;dangerous stage because of these inventions, the new inventions are taking place regularly. Some inventions are highly useful to mankind and some inventions may harmful and may cause severe damages. The only thing is people should not become slaves to the technology, but they can have high usage of it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
