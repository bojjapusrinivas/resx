One of the main reasons for this meltdown is the adapted economic policies of the developed countries. Despite this meltdown, the developing and emerging countries are continuing to grow economically. So as per me, such developing countries will play a major role in reviving the global economic conditions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;Devoloping countries focus on creating money, rather than circulating the existing money. This creation of money is done through&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;exporting the products that are produced by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;&amp;nbsp;manufacturing &amp;amp; agricultural sector.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So governments should focus on improving these sectors.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;Many developed countries outsorce their work to these emerging countries. So, money is coming in to these countries. To make sure that this money is utilized in economic betterment, the developing countries should evealuate their existing econimoc policies and make laws which will avert the situations like recession in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;Developing&amp;nbsp;countries are in the path of becoming developed economies. They have a chance to learn and avoid the mistakes done by the developed countries. These countries should take the help of economists in studying the situations that lead to economic meltdown.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As per me, all the countries, developed, undeveloped and developing, must work with each other in improving the global economy. In this effort, the developing countries have a slight advantage of contributing more than others in betterment of the economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
