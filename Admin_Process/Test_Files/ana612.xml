It&amp;#39;s so impactable for our country. There has many reason to more growth required in our country. It is necesity for every country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We have to required more growth comparison to other country. Our country got freedom in 1947 , since we are growing day by day. But in term of free trade, we couldn&amp;#39;t grow in proper manner as comparison to other country. Free trade is must for developing countries. If we want to growth in our trade industry, we will have to refine and define for genral trading. The Govt. are increasing tax like cst, gst etc. day by day. Slabing of our income level is increasing day by day for getting more and more tax. If we want to grow in actual manner, our govt.will have to make a strong step for common men. Otherwise, there has many harmful effect on our growth. The Govt. should decrease tax and provide the facility for common trader. If our trading concept will be changed, we make high rise automatically. Firstly we should eliminate corruption on priorty bases then&amp;nbsp; we should take another step for growth in developing country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
