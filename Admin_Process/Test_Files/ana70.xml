<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;12/17/2012 2:26:02 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India&amp;#39;s economic matters, there is an excessive tendency towards the thinking rather than doing. Elaborate with examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Mom would say - &amp;quot;Wait and watch, India will soon be a developED nation&amp;quot; and we go - &amp;quot;Ya, right, Mom, how soon?&amp;quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This is the usual and common dialogue between us and our mother on the dining table over a newspaper when we come across any pathetic news describing the downtrodden status of our country. No matter the amount of reforms the politicians promise, how much ever developments are announced, nothing actualises. Looks like it&amp;#39;s all in their brains,&amp;nbsp;seeping through their grey cells, getting&amp;nbsp;absorbed back in between them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;For a country to develop in all its fields, poverty needs to be eradicated from its roots and education&amp;nbsp; be provided to each and everybody. With regard to poverty, India is still &amp;#39;thinking&amp;#39; and hardly anything has been done because even now, there are people dwelling in slums and sickness everywhere. What has been done to&amp;nbsp;wipe out&amp;nbsp;the slums of Mumbai and Delhi?, what has been done to clean up the mess in and around the airports in these regions? Nothing!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Everybody keeps talking about removing the &amp;#39;Beggar - menace&amp;#39;, but we still keep seeing thier pretty faces peeping into our windows at traffic lights, selling bouquets and what not. And to realise that they are working for a big gang scares us immensely and you wish that they would stop begging for our money.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Chidambaram, &amp;#39;The Thinker&amp;#39;! Is he really going to do something about the inflation? The hike in Petrol! Looks like i will have to experiment with water and my car engine to check whether it will run on it. Actually given the condition, soon water will also be sold at water-pumps. Apparently the Middle Eastern countries&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; water and bath in petrol/fuel. So i guess we are better off.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Whatever the economic state of a country, it&amp;#39;s the middle - class which suffers a great deal. The poor become poorer and the rich get richer. The celebrities, politicians&amp;nbsp;and the top-notch have nothing to lose, it&amp;#39;s we the middle-class guys who suffer to the hilt, unfortunately!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The latest FDI idea with India is not going down very well with a certain clan of people. My mom definitely is very happy, and why, only she knows.. Actually i am happy too, knowing that we will get to experience WALMART. Can it get any better? My brother argues that this will cause the shut down of &amp;#39;Big Bazar&amp;#39; but i don&amp;#39;t think so, &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t the rich Ambanis take on a little competition?&amp;quot; I say.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Another very important issue is the environment, if everybody starts caring for it and minimises usage or at least judicioulsy uses the natural resources, there will&amp;nbsp;hardly be&amp;nbsp;any inflation. When things are abundantly available, why increase the price?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Every issue is interlinked, excess usage of natural resources is directly proportional to population. If population is controlled, then commodities become easily available to everyone. Everyone is able to get an education and&amp;nbsp;thereby enable themselves to get an employment; contributing to the economic development of their country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India, the deciding committee keeps deciding/thinking on what to do and what not to do, while the people are the ones who are&amp;nbsp;acting/doing things to keep thier own economies running, for eg; robberies, ATM-loots, scamming truck-loads of money, recieving under-the-table money (ah, corruption, how can i not mention this word?)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Nursery admissions start in January. The first word which comes to the minds of the parents of these tiny tots is MONEY. How&amp;nbsp;will they arrange for all that money which the school authorities are going to eat up as donation to get that little one in and get him a decent education from that fancy place they call school?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;All of us contribute to economy and its development, each one of us has to work towards it, get into our running shoes and run the race instead of standing behind the start line and wondering whether&amp;nbsp;we will finish the race or even run it well. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If you are getting an education , get it well, if you are working somewhere, work well; give your best, doesn&amp;#39;t matter whether you win or lose. What matters is, you contributed your bit.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Therefore, instead of only thinking, the government needs to practice what it&amp;#39;s preaching. If it wants to bring in a certain law for the good of society, they must bring it without&amp;nbsp;preparing files on it and dumping them into a government-office cabinet to rot. We, the people need to obey what our government wants from us and live like good law-abiding citizens.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;quot;Oh come on Mom..not 15 years, you might as well add two zeros after 15&amp;quot;!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
