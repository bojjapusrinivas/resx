&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;5. If there are any meetings, conferences employees can talk with the clients or with the superiors through video conference but which cannot be discussed with the collegues and other key people to take key decisions on the spot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013GlobalAutoIndustryOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Auto Industry is the highly concentrated industry. Auto industry is the top most industry which we use in our day to day life compared to the other industries. We can simply say it as the core industry. There are many auto industries in the world which are very competitive. The share of auto industries decide the positions of the industry. The leading auto industries are Genaral Motors which is at 18% market share and the nexzt followed by Ford motors whose share is 16.4% after that the next one is the Toyota Motors corp and it`s share is 14.2% and the least one is the Nissan Motors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In the present competitive world we need to be better in each and every aspect such as Miles per Km, speed of the vehicle, comfort it provides, low cost, unique design, using advanced technology, according to the tastes of customer, color they prefer, strategy it follows etc. the strategy used also plays a major role in the selection of the automobile company. By using all these the profits of the company can be evaluated and the position of the company can be decided by the market share. The automaker companies shift from high cost regions to the low cost regions that is from northamerica to european union. The growth is more than 50% for light vehicle production in auto industry from 2008 to 2015. And the support of government is very significant.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 &amp;ndash; Global Auto Industry Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In the first five months of 2013, General Motors Company ( GM ) led with a 18.0% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. ( F ) with a 16.4% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. ( TM ) with a 14.2% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 11.7% market share, and Honda Motor Co. ( HMC ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( NSANY ) at the last spots with 9.5% and 8.1% market shares, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;OPPORTUNITIES &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;To remain competitive, the automakers will need to design vehicles that will cater to consumers in both mature and emerging markets while manufacturing them at low-cost using the most advanced technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;For example, Ford has undertaken "One Manufacturing" strategy, which aims at producing multiple models from plants across the world in order to save production costs and fast adaptation to changes in consumer tastes. The automaker anticipates producing 4.5 models at each of its plants by 2015, up from 3.6 models currently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Further, the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features (which will save money on gas), even on the small and less gas-guzzler vehicles in order to attract buyers. The sale of optional features is helping them offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to large trucks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The automakers continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. According to a study by CSM Worldwide, China and South America together will represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The role of governments is highly significant. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years. In late 2011, 13 major automakers, including Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Volvo, have signed letters of commitment with the U.S. Government to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
