Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Indian parliamentary democracy, balanced regional development is possible. In democracy, common people can choose their own leader and vote for the political parties. some of the states in India is not developed like Bihar. State like Gujarat is well developed in India. Balanced regional development is possible when all the states in the country is having equal amount resources. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Population growth is very high in some states and some of the states not having resources. In India, Gujarat&amp;#39;s growth rate is high in past 10 years and Bihar is having very less growth rate. If there are good resources in the state then the development is high and well. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Cities like Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai are well developed because of industrialization. Cities like Punjab and patna are not well developed because of cultivation. Territory sector is giving high revenue to the government through taxes, imports and exports of goods.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government is not allocating sufficient funds for developing the rural areas. Capital cities are developing faster and there will be pressure on cities for employment opportunities. Government is not allocating funds for infrastructure development and sanitation facilities. Corruption is the one of the reason for unbalanced regional development.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Balanced regional development is not possible when there no unity between politicians. If there is proper coordination between politicians, then the balanced regional development is possible. Population is also one of the cause in unbalanced regional development. Inflation, rupee depreciation and Internal clashes&amp;nbsp;are reasons for unbalanced regional development. Problems of development of regions should be discussed in parliament and problems should be solved to the development of regions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India&amp;#39;s growth rate decreased from 7% to 5% because of closing of industries, rupee depreciation. Interest rates for industrial loans have raised so there will be low growth rate. Hence by controlling these factors, India can achieve balanced regional development.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
