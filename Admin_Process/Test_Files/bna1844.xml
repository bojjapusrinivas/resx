&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:IndiaEconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Obsevation from &amp;nbsp;the above &amp;nbsp;analysis on "Indian economic conditions in coming future". &amp;nbsp;"Indian economy is mixed economy it is a combination of both public and private sectors" both sectors play major role in indian economy &amp;nbsp;from last several years india is facing more problems with other countries , so growth if indian economy "mainly depends on global conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; But &amp;nbsp;some of experts saying that india will show the good performance in coming future, becouse india is growing country so every "Foregin invester want to invest in indian companies &amp;nbsp;so it is "big pooertunity for india for catch the global market attention"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &amp;nbsp;the observation of above economic condition of india, we have lOT of scope in 2020, they are expecting that some of "major controbuters of GDP" Like Agriculture , service sector ,capital market and infrastructure sectors will contribute more GDP to indian Economy in 2020. &amp;nbsp;Under consumptions, share of discretionary is expecting to rise significantly to 70% in 2020, share of capital market is 2.2% in coming future, they expecting thatThe share of private sector in infrastructure in 2020 is &amp;nbsp;from 39.4% TO 48.0% and Investment in agriculture sector is expecting to grow aroun 3.2 &amp;nbsp;this are expectoins for performance of indian economy in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India Economic Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India remained remarkably resilient from the global economic turmoil in 2008 owing to its strong domestic fundamentals and had been one of the fastest economies to recover from the crisis. Currently, the growth momentum of the Indian economy has again been impacted. This time around besides the prevailing crisis in some of the developed economies, emergence of certain domestic issues had played a major role in restraining India&amp;rsquo;s growth momentum. However, we believe that India&amp;rsquo;s long term growth prospects will remain buoyant driven by its underlying strong macroeconomic fundamentals. We believe that emphasis on boosting investment activity and setting up of a favorable policy environment will act as a catalyst to unravel the growth potential of the Indian economy during the current decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The highlights of the analysis have been provided below &amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s macro-economic outlook 2020:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India is expected to be more than US$ 5 trillion (current market price) economy by FY20. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The size of the Indian economy will be comparable to the Japanese economy (in terms of GDP in US$) as of 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;We expect the current phase of subdued growth to continue till FY15 before the economy moves into a high growth phase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s economic growth during the current decade is expected to be driven by the buoyancy in the services sector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment activity is expected to accelerate going ahead, which will help the Indian economy achieve a higher growth rate. Share of investment to GDP will increase to stand at 40.7% of GDP during FY20 from 36.6% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Infrastructure will be both a cause and a consequence of economic growth during the current decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Strong growth in domestic savings will support domestic investment. The savings rate is expected to surge to 39.5% during FY20 from 33.8% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Under consumption, share of discretionary spending is expected to rise significantly to 70% of private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) as compared to 60.0% (P) in FY11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic growth drivers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Substantial investments in social and physical infrastructure will be the key growth drivers that will enable the economy to achieve &amp;lsquo;inclusive growth&amp;rsquo; over the current decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Infrastructure investment in the electricity sector is expected to account for 3.8% of GDP by FY20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment in physical infrastructure is expected to lead to employment generation, increased production efficiency, reduction in cost of doing business and improved standard of living which is expected to drive infrastructure investment (as measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation) to 11.5% of GDP by FY20 from around 6.0% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Increased government focus towards improving overall healthcare facilities is expected to enhance total government expenditure on healthcare to 2.2% of GDP in FY20, as against 1.3% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The share of the private sector in infrastructure financing is expected to increase from 39.4% in FY12 (P) to 48.0% in FY20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment in the agriculture sector is expected to grow to around 3.2% of GDP by FY20 as against 2.6% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
