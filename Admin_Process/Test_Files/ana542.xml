Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The development of any country requires the development of agriculture sector. This sector reqiires development because developing countries like India and China there is a more dependency on agriculture. If we take an example of developed countries like America, there is a less dependency on agriculture only 5 to 6 percent people are involve in this sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The second thing is for development of a country is education. If any country has high education then&amp;nbsp;the ecomic condition of that country is high ang theit purchasing power is also high. Developing countries like India has less education than any other developed countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Education and agriculture sector&amp;nbsp; are the two sector for any country&amp;#39;s development.&amp;nbsp;If these two thingh are handled properly&amp;nbsp;by their government then&amp;nbsp;economic condition of any country become high.&amp;nbsp;Each and every economy needs infrastructure for development. China has over invested in infrastructure sector and they are getting benifited by investment in infrastructure sector. On the other hand, India don&amp;#39;t has&amp;nbsp;any plan for over investment in infrastructure sector. Investment in infrastructure starts in India when it requires a lot.&amp;nbsp;Infrastructure work does&amp;#39;t complete on the right time. This is again the main problem for development of any country.&amp;nbsp;Because where there is availability of Road, Building, Bridge and&amp;nbsp;Electrivity&amp;nbsp;that area automatically develop and the people of that area have some&amp;nbsp;source of income like business and&amp;nbsp;small scale industries. These industries helps them a lot for those areas people and their per capita income is also high.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In todays competitive age each and every country need&amp;nbsp;investment in Research &amp;amp; Development (R&amp;amp; D) sector. Only this sector can help to sustain in the market for a longer period of time. Develop countries like America, there is a huge investment in R&amp;amp;D sector. That&amp;#39;s why they are the super power country in&amp;nbsp;the world. It is said that Chinese people go for R&amp;amp;D 10000 to 11000 but Indian people only go for R&amp;amp;D 1000 to 1500. So these things are also measured for improvement of economic condition of any country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to my openion, there are different sector which plays the most important role in driving the economic condition of a country like over investment in infrastructure sector, development of agriculture sector, education and information technology sector research and development sector and providing electricity to every part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
