<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/4/2014 3:39:51 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With media publishing and telecasting irresponsibly, censorship is the need of the hour. Do you agree or disagree? Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I agree with that in some cases , there must be a censorship to media. As media publishes the way that they are not responsible for the cultures and ethics sometimes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;They&amp;nbsp;publish what they know and what they collected. But media have to be responsible about what they are publishing by taking into consideration of all the people that is of all the age groups, cultures.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;some cases about the celebrities they make their lives transparent and show everything what they do. Celebrities are also the persons who need privacy for their personal lives. In&amp;nbsp;such cases also media sometimes make their issues public and they not even think of them before they publish.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As media is considered as the powerful source for public they also have to be responsible towards the society&amp;nbsp;and people. They have to&amp;nbsp;set&amp;nbsp;certain limitations to them so that they should not exceed their limitations. This censorship for media is to be&amp;nbsp;followed for certain cases.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Media have to be more responsible because they are the persons who make people know the situations all over the world. They must be&amp;nbsp;open to all the issues.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;And media consists of both print and electronic media. Both of these used to make people aware of the things what is&amp;nbsp;going on globally. In the past there is no electronic media at that time the major source is only the print media. now a days many&amp;nbsp;media sources are there&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the country.&amp;nbsp;As the sources are increasing responsibility is lacking. Many competitors came into the market&amp;nbsp;as they came into market to serve the society they have to follow the ethics of journalism and make the issues public what the society needs. But now a days media is converted into a commercial advertising&amp;nbsp;and money making business. They sometimes publish some unnecessary issues and silly things.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Media is the source where it have to help the people in the society and&amp;nbsp;to serve them with useful purpose and make the people aware of the news globally. There must be some rules and regulations that must be followed by every media.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I disagree in some cases like crimes, scams, illegal activities that which make the country or society be aware of.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In such cases media have to showcase all the necessary facts and the incidents that will harm the society and make people&amp;nbsp; aware of those situations like rapes, murders ,scams, illegal activities have to be published.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Media have to work for the benefit of all the people in country but not the people like celebrities, political leaders etc. They must show minimum responsibility and should not work for the sake of single person or for making money.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;so they have to feel responsible towards the public and the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
