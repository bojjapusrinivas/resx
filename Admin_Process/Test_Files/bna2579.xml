Suggest measures to be taken by the government to fine-tune the digital payment/cashless economy.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YES the move to demonetize old 500&amp;amp; 1000 rupees notes taken by the government is good measure in order to stop the corruption which is been a major issue in our country. though problems were faced by the public due to the lack of currency but cashless payments were the one of the best ways&amp;nbsp; to public to make payments through this we can make payments anywhere anytime without any troubble.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government has taken measures to educate the people to use the cashless and digital payments so that the problems faced by the people who doesnt know to use the digital payments and can resolve there issues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivating the people to use the digital payments in order to reduce the issues related to it&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting up the helpline centers to guide the people to use them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensuring the security .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Providing knowledge about the digital payment methods.Through this measures&amp;nbsp; the people get influenced to use the cash less payments the major advantage of this is time instead of spending and wasting time in banks to draw the money and making payments just by aclick we can make the payments sitting at home or office without any physical presence in the banks by using the digital payments.payments can be made from anywhere any time without any stress and on time.through this digital payments we can shop online and pay them from our place with out going anywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By providing the helpline centers people can know about the uses of digital payments there benefits and easily adapt the cashless payments.instead of carrying a huge amount of money which is very risky the money can&amp;nbsp; be robbed and we may have to face a major loss we can carry the digital cards and make payments from anywhere anytime.if in case it is lost or stolen it cannot be misused with out knowing the pin which is keep secret not revealed to anybody.we can stop the payments happening with out our consent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GLOBAL SMART GRID VENDOR LANDSCAPE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing o period of change.developed countries in&amp;nbsp; north america,and east asia, markets are consolidating. Large vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain,While communications and data analytics providers are increasingly&amp;nbsp;active across multiple smart grid segments ,improving the coordination between smart metering ,distribution automation and home energy manangement. the market is just beginning to growin across africa, central&amp;amp;eastern eupore,eurasia,latin america, the middle east&amp;amp;north africa,south asia, and southeast asia.dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects,both on their own and partners of large intrenational firmswith high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries this represent thenext frontier of vendor activity and opportunity.across 125 countries,smart grid investment will reach $380.1billion between 2015and 2025. this presents a pictue of the competitive landscape of the hunreads of vendors competing for this growing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRZILIAN SMART GRID MARKET -AN INSIGHT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is alreadyone of the leading emerging market countries interms of smart grid development. with the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eagerto modernize the country`s infrastructure,brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade.it is a product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action.Brazil has high rates of non technical distribution losses, implying that utilities will reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments.As the country to grow,the reliability and energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important.in 2009 it set a non binding target of replacing all 63million existing electromechanical meters with smart meters by2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in august 2012,the government announced an "opt*in" smart meter regulation for existing customers, paired with a mandate to replace all 63 million existing legacy meters with smart meters.As a result, northeast group is currentil forecasting that brazil will not reach its target .some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be acheived, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering reguations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is inevitable that brazil`s smart grid market will grow significantly inthe coming decade.the question is simply how fast deployment will take place,smart meters targeted at reducing non technical losses,and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications,more than haif of the brazilian homes will hane smart meters by the end of the decade.Brazil to meet its original goal by 2021 and remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms. With high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors and smaller, more fragmented local players will help shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. This study takes a comprehensive look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positioning themselves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across all regions of the world, highlights growing regions and market segments, and assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions that are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries, smart grid investment will reach $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. This study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of the hundreds of vendors competing for this growing market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market &amp;ndash; An Insight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development. With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action. Like many emerging market countries, Brazil has high rates of non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also has a rapidly growing economy, which is beginning to strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it&amp;nbsp; set a non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However,&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; August&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2012, the&amp;nbsp; government&amp;nbsp; announced&amp;nbsp; an&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;opt--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;in&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meter&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; regulation&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; customers,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Paired with&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; requiring&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; new&amp;nbsp; customers.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp; was&amp;nbsp; not&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; anticipated&amp;nbsp; market&amp;nbsp; catalyst&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; those&amp;nbsp; expecting&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; binding&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; replace&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million existing legacy&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; result,&amp;nbsp; Northeast&amp;nbsp; Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its initial 63 million smart meter target. Yet, some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be achieved, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;With strong underlying economic and political conditions, it is inevitable that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade. The question is simply how fast deployments will take place. Through a combination of new meter installations, smart meters targeted at reducing non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt; technical losses, and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications, more than half of Brazilian homes will have smart meters by the end of the decade. However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
