To what extent do you agree with this statement? Provide reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Economic and infrastructural planning of an area should be done bearing in mind of the environment conservation. As per the statement i agree strongly with it because, In recent scenario the world is facing a critical situation of global warming.Economy of a country depends &amp;nbsp;majorly on industries as well as other features which can add up for the growth of economy.In fact Economy can be called as a back bone of a country.Economy of a country majorly deals with the industries there will be a requirement of different type of plants of infrastructures to be constructed. In the past scenario major industries which makes a major impact on the environment certainly to say polluting the environment and releasing polluted gases which are very harmfull to the environment like methane gases,chlouroflouro carbons which makes a serious impact on the environment as well as it will also effect the temparature of the earth in which the temparature of earth has been raised.It is also harmfull to health of human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In the past decades the major impact on environment by these polluted and harmfull gases was recognised by the environment safeguarders and warned the countries which are not at all caring about the environment.Several scientist conducted experiments and came to know how badly the impact was made on the environment by different type of harmfull gases producing industries.the serious issues to be considered during these experiments are global warming and holes in the Ozone layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Global warming is the rise of earth temparature beyond the limit which makes the temparature more at poles as well as all over the world.hence due to raising of the temparature the ice in the poles is to melted and getting towards the nearest countries.It will leads to different type of floods which can impact the economic crisis and social conditions of nearest countries to poles.This will also had a impact on other countries which has made treaties with the other countries all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Secondly about the ozone layer, it is the layer above the earth surface which helps &amp;nbsp;in avoiding the direct fall of sun rays on the skin of people all over the world.If the rays are fallen directly over the skin it will leads to skin diseases and other health hazards. But, due to these polluted gases the ozone layer has been got holes on its layer which leads to fall the rays on sun directly on &amp;nbsp;skin.These is the main reason behind the raise of temparature as well as it will also leads to uneven increase or raise of temparature without depending on seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Hence as a conclusion some of the &amp;nbsp;infrastructural planning of an area which are developed for manufacturing plants or other industries which results in serious hazard to environment should be banned or atleast should follow preventive methods to minimize or to cease completely the impact on environment.Some of the preventive methods are planting plants in near by areas of plats which consumes harmfull gases like carbondioxide and other gases and release oxygen.It can be called as best preventive method.It will also regulates the temparature to be normal for the welfare of human beings.By folowing different preventive methods developed by scientists we can conserve our environment which increases the growth of economy as well as safeguarding the human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India Economic Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indian economy has been raised as one of the fastest economies country which has been recovered from the global economy turmoil in 2008 due to its strong domestic fundamentals.Several countires faced a crisis during this period and took a vast period of time to get back its previous position.At present situation the indian economy has been impacted other countires again in which the developing countries are facing crisis,as well as &amp;nbsp;are facing emergence of some domestic issues.This helps in restraining indian economy growth.however we can say Indian country has long term growth prospects which have been driven by strong macro economic fundamentals.It is the strongest factor for the growth of indian economy.In current decade there are also some other important aspects which impacts and speed up the growth of Indian economy such as encouraging investors to invest in different countries by smoothing up the policy environment.As several investors from different countries are keenly interested in investing funds.Favourable policies can help them to invest money and acquire a good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important features of the analysis have been provded below-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s macro-economic outlook 2020:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;As per the analysis made by the experts in economy,due to their economic fundamentals and rapid raise in economy after crisis they have been expected Indian economy can be more than US$ 5 trillion (current market price) by fiscal year 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Indian economy size can be compared to the japaneese country economy (in terms of GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT in US$ )as of 2010.There is a expectation of subdue growth of economy to be continued till the FY 15 before the economy of a country can have a rapid growth phase. As the governement of India has been smoothen the policies for investors there is a lot of investment activities being expected to get acclerated and move on.This aspect can help the economy of india to achieve a higher growth rate in which the share of investment to GDP &amp;nbsp;will move forward to stand at 40.7% of GDP durinf FY20 from 36.6% during FY10. This can give a clear and concise point of rapid growth in economy of Indian country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Infrastructure can be consided as a both cause and a consequence of growth in economy during present decade.There is also a strong growth in domestic savings which support domestic investment.The rate of savings has been expected to raise from 39.5% during FY20 from 33.8% during FY10.In case of consumption, share of items spending has been expected to rise mostly to 70% of private final consumption expenditure(PFCE) as compared to 60.0% in FY11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Economic growth drivers:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In current decade for the "inclusive growth" of economy in India,continous investments in social and physical infrastructure will be the key aspects.INfrastructure investment in the sector of electricity is expected to obtain 3.8% of GDP by FY20. Investment in physical infrastructure can be expected to lead for employment generation, which can increases production efficiency, reducing the cost of doing business and improving the standard of living which can be expected as 11.5% of GDP by FY20 from approximately 6.0% (BE) of GDP in FY12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The other aspects such as private sector in infrastructure financing has expected to increase from 39.4% in FY12 to 48.0% in FY20.In cases of agriculture which is one of the source for growth of indian economy has been expected to grow around 3.2% of GDP by FY20 from 2.6% (BE) of GDP in FY12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India Economic Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India remained remarkably resilient from the global economic turmoil in 2008 owing to its strong domestic fundamentals and had been one of the fastest economies to recover from the crisis. Currently, the growth momentum of the Indian economy has again been impacted. This time around besides the prevailing crisis in some of the developed economies, emergence of certain domestic issues had played a major role in restraining India&amp;rsquo;s growth momentum. However, we believe that India&amp;rsquo;s long term growth prospects will remain buoyant driven by its underlying strong macroeconomic fundamentals. We believe that emphasis on boosting investment activity and setting up of a favorable policy environment will act as a catalyst to unravel the growth potential of the Indian economy during the current decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The highlights of the analysis have been provided below &amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s macro-economic outlook 2020:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India is expected to be more than US$ 5 trillion (current market price) economy by FY20. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The size of the Indian economy will be comparable to the Japanese economy (in terms of GDP in US$) as of 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;We expect the current phase of subdued growth to continue till FY15 before the economy moves into a high growth phase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s economic growth during the current decade is expected to be driven by the buoyancy in the services sector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment activity is expected to accelerate going ahead, which will help the Indian economy achieve a higher growth rate. Share of investment to GDP will increase to stand at 40.7% of GDP during FY20 from 36.6% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Infrastructure will be both a cause and a consequence of economic growth during the current decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Strong growth in domestic savings will support domestic investment. The savings rate is expected to surge to 39.5% during FY20 from 33.8% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Under consumption, share of discretionary spending is expected to rise significantly to 70% of private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) as compared to 60.0% (P) in FY11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic growth drivers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Substantial investments in social and physical infrastructure will be the key growth drivers that will enable the economy to achieve &amp;lsquo;inclusive growth&amp;rsquo; over the current decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Infrastructure investment in the electricity sector is expected to account for 3.8% of GDP by FY20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment in physical infrastructure is expected to lead to employment generation, increased production efficiency, reduction in cost of doing business and improved standard of living which is expected to drive infrastructure investment (as measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation) to 11.5% of GDP by FY20 from around 6.0% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Increased government focus towards improving overall healthcare facilities is expected to enhance total government expenditure on healthcare to 2.2% of GDP in FY20, as against 1.3% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The share of the private sector in infrastructure financing is expected to increase from 39.4% in FY12 (P) to 48.0% in FY20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
