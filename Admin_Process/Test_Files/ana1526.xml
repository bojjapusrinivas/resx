What has been the performance of small states that were carved out previously from large states? Have they fulfilled the demands of the people or is it just plain power politics at play?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Yes, India really need smaller states why because it will fulfil the demands of the people. For India to progress, smaller states are needed. People who are located in those states are also demanded the same thing. Government&amp;nbsp;was also taken actions when a separate state is needed in previously. Politicians are ready to take a step to make a separate state when people of that state are wanted. Previously some states&amp;nbsp;are separated from other states we seen in newspapers, television channels. what they want from separate state is high growth, quality of education, right government to rule etc. In India, presently total 29 states are there. All these states are having there own government and own culture. When growth is needed it will be possible only by small states are rised in India. Though this government also known&amp;nbsp;the fact that when state is bifurcated growth is possible in the state. Some of our political parties are also demanded bifurcation of the state. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India all the political leaders of the all political parties are make an issue in the parliament for demanding&amp;nbsp;the state bifurcation when the people of that state&amp;nbsp;are demanded. By bifurcation of state people fulfilled their demands what they demands. Recently, Andhra Pradesh state also bifurcated into two states&amp;nbsp;as we known by last month of June 2nd. This makes a great revolution in recent times. All resources of both states equally shared to both states. And funds from central government are also equally given to both states.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Finally, My conclusion is by bifurcation of states government can easily ruled their government in that states as well as growth of that state economically increased.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
