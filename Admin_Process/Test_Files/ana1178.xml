<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:31:28 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In india there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand as most of the healthcare organisations do not providing the quality services to the patients so it leads to poor service to the patients. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Government organisations/hospitals are providing very poor quality service to the patients who are in need. Most of the poor families prefer to go government hospitals as they charge very low fee, but these government hospitals do not take much care about their patients. private organisations are doing much better when compared to government organisations. Compared to government&amp;nbsp;hospitals the private hospitals charge is high. These private organisations always want to show their best to the patients and want to give the quality service to them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; To overcome this problem the government should take the following steps:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The government should provide free medical camp services once in a month in every village/town.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;They should provide equal and fair&amp;nbsp;charges to all the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The government should see that all the medical organisations should have all the lab facilities, x-ray rooms and&amp;nbsp;scanning centres with latest equipments.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;They should implement new schemes in the healthcare systems like providing free medical facilities to the poor families with low charge, the treatment should made first rather than paying the money first.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Most of the members in the healthcare organisations are corrupted, to make more money by providing treatment&amp;nbsp;to the patients in an unfair manner. The government should punish those people who are involved in this.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The government should make new plans and build hospitals in backward areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The government should implement new schemes for poor people by charging less fee&amp;nbsp;and providing concession to them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In india their is a demand for healthcare but the supply is not equal to the demand. In some hospitals the doctors/management may demand for more money from the patients as they want make profits. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Most of the healthcare organisations do not have all the facilities to treat their patients so it leads to lack of supply.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In earliier days we don&amp;#39;t have&amp;nbsp;much&amp;nbsp;technology to improve the healthcare system, but now the days has changed and technology&amp;nbsp;also changed much more, so the government should take a step forward and improve our healthcare system as it leads to better service to our society.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So i conclude this by saying that, it&amp;nbsp;is important to improve healthcare system in india. for&amp;nbsp;improving the healthcare system the&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;government should implement new schemes and policies for providing better supply of healthcare system in india with all facilities as it leads to not only improving&amp;nbsp;the healthcare system but also&amp;nbsp;helps us to improve our society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
