&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;if the govt and other authoritys are providing this faster mode of transportation it is more benfit for all the job holders and alos major benfit is for the &amp;nbsp;public &amp;nbsp;if they are using this faster mode of transportation is bullet trains we can reduse the polliution in citys &amp;nbsp;many matro politen citys are critical damage by the polliution of moter car, scooters, bikes, etc it relise harmfull smoke from it .it can make human life effected to over come this problem . bullet trains &amp;nbsp;are important to make human life esssy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;it reduses the polliution and trafic in citys are one of the major problem it creates &amp;nbsp;huge polliution, diffcult for human life,makes the people stress. if we all support public services we can over come the problems in citys by the faster means of transportation that is bullet trains and we can save environimental.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;coming to &amp;nbsp;better trains &amp;nbsp;we can`t &amp;nbsp;totaly agree only &amp;nbsp;bullet trains are need or better tranis. becase we need both but only drowback &amp;nbsp;in better it always be better only means bit of slow &amp;nbsp;so that it reach the person &amp;nbsp;late at his working place so thta impact on his working times and working conditions. &amp;nbsp;so better to have &amp;nbsp;bullet trains. all most in other countrys in developd countrys all ready it is existing &amp;nbsp;in faster mode of transportation to reach them right &amp;nbsp;time and right place.it is very important and other countrys are really doing will there is one disadvantage because of time they may have some problem &amp;nbsp;and with huge people &amp;nbsp; at a time in train in some cases but not all the time .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;in india if they provide bullet trains &amp;nbsp;surely i can say that there will no issus on late times, polliution, trafic. the benfites of the bullet trains are it takes less cost, on time process, faster means of transportation, right time and rirgt place. disadvantage in bullet trains it is not smooth travel, if the person is late him self then it may cross his distination because of the one person it cant stop &amp;nbsp;or wait until u get down or get into, it is very fast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
