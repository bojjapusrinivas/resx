Toyota stands first in the place of sales in the year 2013. The manufacturing companies (companies) mainly cincentrate on the areas were the cost of production is less &amp;amp; the demand for the product is high, this is the biggest factor which helps in increasing the sales of the company. Now a days, companies are trying to manufacture auto parts by its own which helps in reducing the cost cutting by saving the amount paid to the third party suppliers. This helps the comapnies to be independent with out having any threats of time delay &amp;amp; quality of the vehicle will be up to the standards and this also will help the companies to create its own designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fuels which are harmful to human is being replaced by bio fuels, which is prepared from the renewable sources and fossil fuels. This helps in cost deduction and also helps in pollution control. Fuel efficient electric vehicles (green cars) are encouraged by the government of USA. Companies are ahead manufacturing both types of vehicles to increase the sales. Companies like Toyota, Honda, General Motors, Nissan etc., are trying to push the hybrid sales. Green cars helped the companies to increase the hybrid sales to 70%. The best green car of Ford is the For Focus. As the electric cars &amp;amp; green cars helped in the sales &amp;amp; revenue generation and is no less pollutant. US department of Energy accepted in producing more number of cars by the year 2015, the plug in cars with litium battery have less demand &amp;amp; did not help in generating more sales. In 2009, Massachetus based A123 Systems Inc &amp;amp; NewYork based EnerDel together joined with Dow Chemical and operated with TK Advanced Battery, LLC to improve the sales and concentrate on revenue generation after both the comapnies were bankrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don&amp;#39;t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;World Auto Industry Outlook - June 2013 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM&amp;#39;s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany&amp;#39;s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Although automakers continue to focus on shifting their production facilities to new regions driven by cost and demand factors, developing the supplier networks remains one of their greatest challenges. Existing suppliers to automakers often lack the financial strength to expand capacity in new markets. On the other hand, auto parts suppliers are sensitive to technology transfers to local third parties, which can give rise to low-cost competitors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;High dependence on automakers makes the auto market suppliers vulnerable to several maladies, primarily pricing pressure and production cuts. Pricing pressure from automakers constricts parts suppliers&amp;#39; margins. On the other hand, production cuts by automakers driven by frequent market adjustments negatively affect their operations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Future of Green Cars Looks Bleak &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Rising fuel prices and global warming have turned attention to the auto industry that either rely less on traditional fossil fuels or use cheaper renewable sources of energy. Despite the U.S. Government&amp;#39;s continued effort to promote &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; alternatives such as fuel-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles, things look bleak, at least in the near future. Globally, the hybrid market is ruled by Toyota (which includes the Prius) and Honda (includes Civic and Insight hybrids). Meanwhile, other automakers such as Ford, General Motors and Nissan are also aggressively pursuing a plan to push hybrid sales. Some of the well-recognized &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; cars include the Ford Focus, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf and Daimler AG&amp;#39;s ( DDAIF ) smart USA micro EV. U.S. is the largest hybrid car market in the world with sales accounting for 60%-70% of global hybrid sales. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;However, the industry has witnessed some notable adverse developments in the drive for green technology. In January 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) backed off President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s stated goal of putting 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015 due to weaker than expected demand for plug-ins/EVs. According to Hybridcars.com, plug-in/EV sales constituted a meager 3.3% of the overall sales in the U.S. in 2012. The weak demand for plug-ins/EVs has led some lithium-ion battery makers file for bankruptcy protection in 2012. They include MA-based A123 Systems Inc. and NY-based EnerDel, despite both being DOE grant recipients (A123 - $249.1 million; EnerDel - $118.5 million). It also led another DOE grant recipient (in fact, the third largest with $161.0 million), Dow Kokam, to be written down by chemical behemoth Dow Chemical ( DOW ), who jointly operated the entity with TK Advanced Battery LLC since 2009.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
