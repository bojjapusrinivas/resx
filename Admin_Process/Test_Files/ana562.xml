What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the world where everything is moving at such a impeccable speed,where technolgy is growing at a speed faster than the&amp;nbsp;speed of&amp;nbsp;light and where people are not even bothered about their social life and regardlessly working hard to ensure their upliftment&amp;nbsp;of status in the society&amp;nbsp;. This is the scenario of the present world in the urban cities( so &lt;strong&gt;called BIG cities&lt;/strong&gt;) &amp;nbsp;in what we live in.These&amp;nbsp;cities are&amp;nbsp;,in&amp;nbsp;this decade, being over burdened with&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;and more people getting attracted to the cities to fullfill their basic needs of&amp;nbsp;life. Since I Belong to a urban city( to be stated as &amp;quot;gaon&amp;quot; suits better) , I deeply feel that as the world is progressing , rural cities are continuously being pushed back with no signs of help either from the Govenment or from the private firms. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India , the results of such cases can be seen very easily. For example , Our city New Delhi is nowadays so much crowded with people of all states that it sometimes becomes difficult for people to even inhale a fresh pack of air from the atmosphere. The main reason behind the accumulation of such population is the lack of facilities provided by the Government in the rural areas. Tell me , why would yoyu want to leave your family , your beloved ones and all other contacts of yours if you are being well educated in your city and also get a handsome salary alongwith some good places of refreshment. This is what a normal Working class&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;font size="2"&gt;person wants in his life.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Not only Delhi , there are many cities such as Bangalore, Mumbai, Vadodara, Hyderabad&amp;nbsp;which has become the center of every needs&amp;nbsp;for students, working class people and even poor labourers. Now when&amp;nbsp;demands of every people living in a country&amp;nbsp;begin to&amp;nbsp;be fulfilled at one single place, Then the place&amp;nbsp;gradually becomes a &lt;strong&gt;Fish Market&lt;/strong&gt; and not a city for sophisticated people.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If this continues to happen then, in the context of fiction stories, I believe these cities will be buried into the earth with all the weight of people on it. But&amp;nbsp;based&amp;nbsp;the facts provided on the websites , then nobody will be left in the rural areas to&amp;nbsp;cultivate our farms and produce food and thus our so agriculture , which is the backbone of our econumy, may soon become history.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is time when something should be done on every level of industry and business so as&amp;nbsp; to improve the present condition of our downgrading rural areas. Ther are many ways to do so . One of the very important thing that can be done by the Goveernment is to&amp;nbsp; establish better education facilities&amp;nbsp;and open reputed colleges/schools so that students can graduate living in&amp;nbsp;their hometown among&amp;nbsp;their people.&amp;nbsp; But doing this alone only will not benfit the people or the society. the Government should also encourage of types of Industries to expand themselves not only to the major cities but also to cities which are establishing themselves. For this the Government should make an agreement to provide each and every facilities to the companies/industries who are taking steps to expand themselves to rural cities.The companies just can&amp;#39;t&amp;nbsp; bear every expense&amp;nbsp;on themselves&amp;nbsp;and start-up in a new city. There must have to be a joint co-operation and mutual understanding between the companies and the government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The Main reason for the degradation of our vastly recognised Farming and agriculture history&amp;nbsp;is that the farmers not getting the pay which they deserve&amp;nbsp;. Due to so many corrupt mediators in between the farmers and the government it the farmer who has to suffer. In this case why will a farmwer not want that his child must not face the same and prepare to become an Engineer or a Doctor or a Government officer. It can be understandable that if a child&amp;nbsp;has been&amp;nbsp;brilliant in his academics then he deserves to chase his dream job but what if &amp;nbsp;the child just wants to go to the cities&amp;nbsp;leaving behind farming. Thus in this case , the Government should setup special courses in colleges related to farming and agriculture. These course should be treated equally with all other courses.Government should also setup authorities where the farmers can directly contact to the government and sell their output at a reasonable rate.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Setting up Factories in rurals areas will enable more and more labour to work in their own city. These days labour run to bigger cities in search of greater wage ( well who doesn&amp;#39;t wants a better pay) since the current daily wages&amp;nbsp;of workers&amp;nbsp;working in the rural areas are not enough to feed&amp;nbsp;their families .Those companies which are running since ages in the smaller cities&amp;nbsp;still follow the wage&amp;nbsp;pay grade &amp;nbsp;that has been prevailing since their grandfather&amp;#39;s times , ignoring the fact that the world has changed since then and also has become a lot more costlier. This leads labour to move out of the city&amp;nbsp; and work away from their family and children. Government should try to set a fixed wage system in all types of companies so that labours also find it suitable to work in such environment where they are treated well and also paid well.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;One of the other reason is the lack of business opportunity option which people doesn&amp;#39;t find in smaller cities. People try to seek opportunity to setup their small business in a city where they can get a good amount of crowd so as to have a healthy sale for the day and thus they leave there hometown in search of a place which is heavily crowded. The solution to this problem comes with the solution to setting up of colleges, schools , companies , factories , etc in rural cities. Once the city starts establishing with all the required standards of living then the city automatically starts progressing and attract people to invest in the city.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There are many other reason that can explain the reasons why people prefer Big cities. Attracting people to small cities can be achieved by the efforts of an individual or a community. It has to our Government along with the joint efforts of&amp;nbsp;the MNC&amp;#39;s and other companies&amp;nbsp;who can uplift the present condition of our rural societies.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
