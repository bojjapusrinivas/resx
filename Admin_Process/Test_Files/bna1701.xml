&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;The main cause of Climate change and nature calamities is the `Ozone&amp;rsquo; layer covering the Earth atmosphere is getting thinner and lighter as the days and centuries go on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As we all know that the atmosphere surrounding us is getting polluted day by day viz., air pollution, water pollution etc., the reason for all these is, the authorised people are not planning properly when it is concern with the establishment of Industrial plants viz., chemical, Manufacturing units of health care products, motor vehicles and all the units which are meant to developing the products. For, the sake of money the people who are authorized to take decision on this are not planning and just ignoring the health and wealth of the people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In India, we all know the day by day Our Country is developing in multiple sectors viz., Industrial sector, Mechanical sector, Health sector etc., as the days progress we see the manufacturing units, industrial plants and Research units for Health care are established around the country rapidly. We are not opposing the fact that it should be done for the development of the nation and its economy in International standards, but not at the stake of Health of people of the nation. Now days, for establishment of the industries we are cutting down the trees and the lakes, ponds are being closed by dumping them with the soil making them ready for the sale to plant a manufacturing unit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We could see the units are mainly established in villages and outskirts of the city that too by cutting down the trees and forests. After the industries established the waste gases are released in the atmosphere that affecting the people when they inhale the air, due to which the people are suffering with unknown diseases. The best example is the Bhopal Gas Disaster. The people are still suffering with the damage caused by the accident, as the new generations are born with the effect of the poisonous gases inhaled by their ancestors. The Liquid wastage of the units are released in the water which are some part of the corner are linked with the lakes people use it for drinking water, by drinking this the people are affected with diseases and the individuals around them are effected with the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Aforesaid constraints effect the climate change, because earlier days we had the days where the people enjoy the climate change as per the months we know viz., Winter, Summer, Rainy and Monsoon. Now a days, we see there is no rain in the country in rainy season and the summer is scaring &amp;amp; killing the people before it comes.&amp;nbsp; Coming to winter season earlier people use to plan and enjoy the season whereas now it is scaring people and killing them with cold and unknown diseases.&amp;nbsp;This is because the Ice bugs and mountains are melting in the Himalayan region due to polluted air around it which causing the air get cooler and chiller day by day. When comes to rainy season it is same.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Main cause is deforestration and cutting down the surrounding trees for the sake of development and industrialization. Simple thing that need to followed that keep the surrounding Clean and Green. The authorized people should frame the policy that the industry constrution and establishment should be done in the location which is far from the people and wastage gases, liquid wastage need to dumped in the area where it should not effect the atmosphere around us. The R&amp;amp;D(Research and Development) units should not be placed near the residential area where the people crowed is more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Planting tress around will help us a lot, the trees absorb the unwanted gases and release oxygen and by blowing air heavliy the unwanted gases may go out and destroyed. &amp;nbsp;By controlling the atmosphere pollution and keeping the surroundings Clean &amp;amp; Green, we can combat climate changes and lead our lifes Healthier by enjoying the climate as the Seasons changes in Nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
