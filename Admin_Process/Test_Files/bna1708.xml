<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/27/2015 5:11:15 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Computers play an advanced rolo in our daily life. Their technology and they have been changing daily i.e the new and advanced technology is being used day by day. First computer was discover by charless babage. But it was big in size and high in cost and slow in operation. That is called first generation of computer. At present we are using fourth generation computers, means we are using computers less in size and low in cost and high in operation and storage. We will get the fifth generation computers as soon as possible i.e the process is under research. Olden days if you want to search any file in any organisation personnel have to put a lot of effort but now a dasy you will do it just with in the fraction of seconds. That why every organisation is using computers to increase their performance. Schoos also are going to implement the e-learning instead of books i.e in one laptop or note book we maintain all the books. This makes them easy to follow the syllobus and students will get free from burden of books. At present students get a lof of books hold and transfer them school to house and vis-a-vis. Aeroplanes are using computers to give tickets to the customers on online. This makes the consumbers very comfortable and reduce the time and cost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;According your question I agree it. Why beacuse computers are involoved in our lives a lot. We are using the internet to purchase the provision like dress and shoes and electronic items through virtual market or internet market. Computer users also increasing day by day. We have a lot of companies like amazon and flipkart and myntra.com and paytm. They offer so many things and give discouts and provide shipment also. And every Student is going to buy the laptop in graduation or ofter graduation. Because they have to learn the c, java, dbms ect languages in their education. Then the managements of colleges tell to their students to buy the computer to your own purpose. Apart from that now a days, I think, no student have an account in facebook and twitter and quiker. Beacuse they are playing a vital role in our daily life. We get a lot of information from those social websites like jobs and updated news. If you want some address in particular area then you will go to internet and search for that and get it. What ever the information you need to require you will get that with in the fraction of seconds. The technology has been growing day by day and increase the living life of the human being and enrich us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Apart from that, We have to give the importance to the technology but in limetedly. Because One of the scientist told that we don`t give too much development to the technology like artificial technology. There is one time it will became the bane to our entire human race. Apart from that there are uses as well as problems from technology. We are always make them superior than technology because we are the creators of the technology. We will always be in a postion to solve any problem related to the technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Apart from that sudent go to internet and watch unwanted websites and spoit their lives also. They also put some marping photos of girls in websites. Then girls and their family members face a lot of humuiliation from their neibourhoods. There is no safe to the womens in the digital world. And rapes and other things are increasing day by day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;My conclusion abou this topic is We have to use the technology what we needed. Every body use the the technology to good for the human being. We have to be infront of the technology i.e we have to face any problem in our future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:WorldAutoIndustryOutlookJune2013&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auto industry is one of the biggest industry in our world. There are number of people depended&amp;nbsp;on this industry. And it is one of the fastest developed sector. That`s why Andhra Pradesh CM Nara chandra babu naidu have gone to the japan for auto mobile industry. Because Japan is famous for the automobile spare parts. The auto industry is proving a number of goods to entire world. Every country need this sector due to fulfill their needs. There are number of companies have been entered and gone but industry is same. Every body use so many things daily like cars and machines and other parts. Approximately 80% of the top ten companies prodution is done in america and 90% it`s prodution is sold in USA. Because american people are educated people. They use the advanced technology. In 2012 Toyoto from japan is crossed the sales of the General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehecles. Then second place is General Motors and third place is volkswagen AG from Germany and it`s sales are approximately 9 million vehicles in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You said that auto makers continue to shift their production facilities to one place to another place beacuse they want to reduce thir cost and as well as they want cheap labour for their work. Then they invest more money in this sector and they provide a lot of jobs to the people. Apart from that india has sufficient people to make the products. Companies try to put the industry in india. That`s why they always change their sector in one place to another. But now a days indians are in perfect position because we have number of resources and young people. They don`t change their production place they face investment problems and resources problems and they will be in postion to not give any compition to their opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In china we can get the things very cheaply because there are number of prodution companies. They produce trillions of the materials daily. They can sell their products in entire world very chaply. At present we look the things from china in entire world. Recently Our PM Narendra modi told in advertisement Make in india. This means we produce products largely. But RBI governer noticed that the world can not bare any other country like china. We make the products for our country needs only.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a days the polution level has been reaching dangerous position day by day. We have to use the new technology in the place of existed one. We have to use use nature friendly technology and make our live very comfortble. Other wise the entire human race will be wiped out. That`s why we have use the electronic cars and e-learning in the place of fuel cars and books. Because due to the global warming we have decrease the level of harmful gases in our world. US Government contines to effort on green fuels like power and gas ect to use in cars and busses, fuel-efficient electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles ect. Globally, the hybrid market is ruled by toyoto and honda. Other companies like ford, general motors are also trying to put a plan for the hybrid sales. And nature friendly cars also have been using day by day. Because people get awareness about the nature and use those products. That`s why US is the one biggest country use theses cars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However. the industry is trying to harness the green technology. In january 2013, President of USA said that one million electric cars are on the road by 2015. Some websites noted that at present ther 3.3% people use the green cars in US in 2012. Because in green cars number of problems are there like charging and technical knowledge. Those are cars are sufford from the battery back up and security and there are insufficient persons in the servicing field. Suppose any problem will arise in the green technology cars there few people can provide servicing. That`s why people don`t prefer to use them. But companies have to find advanced technology to overcome those problems. They include MA-based for plug-ins/EVs has led lithium - ion battery makers file for bankruptcy protection in 2012.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;World Auto Industry Outlook - June 2013 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Although automakers continue to focus on shifting their production facilities to new regions driven by cost and demand factors, developing the supplier networks remains one of their greatest challenges. Existing suppliers to automakers often lack the financial strength to expand capacity in new markets. On the other hand, auto parts suppliers are sensitive to technology transfers to local third parties, which can give rise to low-cost competitors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;High dependence on automakers makes the auto market suppliers vulnerable to several maladies, primarily pricing pressure and production cuts. Pricing pressure from automakers constricts parts suppliers` margins. On the other hand, production cuts by automakers driven by frequent market adjustments negatively affect their operations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Future of Green Cars Looks Bleak &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Rising fuel prices and global warming have turned attention to the auto industry that either rely less on traditional fossil fuels or use cheaper renewable sources of energy. Despite the U.S. Government`s continued effort to promote "green" alternatives such as fuel-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles, things look bleak, at least in the near future. Globally, the hybrid market is ruled by Toyota (which includes the Prius) and Honda (includes Civic and Insight hybrids). Meanwhile, other automakers such as Ford, General Motors and Nissan are also aggressively pursuing a plan to push hybrid sales. Some of the well-recognized "green" cars include the Ford Focus, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf and Daimler AG`s ( DDAIF ) smart USA micro EV. U.S. is the largest hybrid car market in the world with sales accounting for 60%-70% of global hybrid sales. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However, the industry has witnessed some notable adverse developments in the drive for green technology. In January 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) backed off President Barack Obama`s stated goal of putting 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015 due to weaker than expected demand for plug-ins/EVs. According to Hybridcars.com, plug-in/EV sales constituted a meager 3.3% of the overall sales in the U.S. in 2012. The weak demand for plug-ins/EVs has led some lithium-ion battery makers file for bankruptcy protection in 2012. They include MA-based A123 Systems Inc. and NY-based EnerDel, despite both being DOE grant recipients (A123 - $249.1 million; EnerDel - $118.5 million). It also led another DOE grant recipient (in fact, the third largest with $161.0 million), Dow Kokam, to be written down by chemical behemoth Dow Chemical ( DOW ), who jointly operated the entity with TK Advanced Battery LLC since 2009.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
