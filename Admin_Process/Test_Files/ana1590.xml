<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;7/24/2014 4:03:37 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For India to progress, do we really need smaller states? What has been the performance of small states that were carved out previously from large states? Have they fulfilled the demands of the people or is it just plain power politics at play? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have seen the partition during 1947 where the two countries emerged in the world viz., India and Pakistan later on we witnessed the formation of Bangladesh which really does not require at that juncture where the whole country fought for the freedom and suddenly the power politics came into play in the name of satisfying the needs of some section of the society. My view in giving this introduction is that there is no need for smaller states for India to progress.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Now, we may proudly say that India is far better than the other two countries which were partitioned but the loss which had been suffered during those days is known to the sufferers only. Hence coming to the present scenario of formulating smaller states does not showed the result what the government has expected and we can see the effect of this division of states in Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Chattisgarh where the development process is affected by the division of bigger states.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Even today these small states are lacking in formulating the policies because of lack of resources ( particularly financial), if we take the example of Uttarakhand , last year we witnessed the floods evacuating the major portion of kedarnath and badrinath and roads were damaged but till now there was no proper measures were taken to solve the issue and now due to heavy rains the same or the almost the same scenario is being witnesses with roads getting blocked and there is no proper rescue measures were taken up. Chattisgarh is still facing the maoist problem, Jharkhand having all the problems which a state should have. Hence this shows the failure of governments in providing ample resources while formulating small states.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The latest venture made by the UPA government is division of Andhra Pradesh. Yes, in one sense it looks to be good but lack of proper visualisation of the problems the division was made and the suffering can be easily observed and the state governments are suffering a lot in streamlining the problems that are aroused due to bifurcation of the state of Andhra Pradesh. This shows the complete Political play which proved costlier for the Congress government and the picture is known to all of us.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Therefore, before formulating smaller states the governments have to look into the problems which may arise in the future out of bifurcation and not at the demands of some people backed by the politicians. Having learnt from the A.P. issue the present and the future governments should take care before going for partitioning the bigger states into smaller states. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Finally, I conclude by saying that for India to progress well in future let the bigger states be given more resources and freedom in formulating policies for developing nook and corner of the state&amp;nbsp;such that the minds of the people will not get polluted by the politicians who are looking for their own benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
