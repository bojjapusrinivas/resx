The economies of India &amp;amp; China are developing at cat speed which makes them entitled to an immense growth of 40% in the auto industry in the next five to seven years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ford says that Asia, especially India &amp;amp; China, have an extreme expansion of sales by 50% to 8 million vehicles by 2015 because of their potential growth &amp;amp; increasing demands for small cars. As per the automaker&amp;#39;s estimation, in comparison to 48% of demand for small cars in the present scenario, it will rise up to 55% by 2020 . This means that 1/3rd market of the small cars will be captured by Asia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per Ford India will have a positive balance of trade as for the very first time &amp;nbsp;the engine products from India will be shipped to Europe. The present numbers says that 40% of the engines &amp;amp; 25% of the cars made in India are exported to 35 countries. To increase the numbers to 4.5lac cars &amp;amp; 6lac engines, the company has invested a hefty amount of $2 billions. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a part of major expansion plan this year, General Motors will build four new plants in China which will push forth its production to 5 million vehicles &amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; triple its exports from chinese plants by 2015 . A further investment of $11billion will be &amp;nbsp;done in 2016.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2009, supressing U.S, China became the biggest auto market player by floating incentives &amp;amp; offers for small cars. In the last five years, China had waterrmarked itself at the 3rd postion for light vehicles sales growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as said what rises up has to cum down.In 2011 as a result of high sale, Bejing governemt started facing the problem of road congestions and to curb that it started imposing quotas on new car registration which dragged the growth rate by 8%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2013, the auto industry presents a vision of overpowering U.S as a major trend setter. &amp;nbsp;Chinese government assumes that the total vechicle sale in China is expected to rise from 19.3% in 2012 to 7.8% to 20.8 million vehicles in 2013. If we beleive CAAM, the SUV&amp;#39;s will continue to be the fastest growing segment in the year keeping commercial vehicles sale in a moderate stream .&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don&amp;#39;t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;June 2013 - Auto Industry Outlook for Asia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Asia Promises High Growth &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;The Asian countries, especially China and India, are expected to account for 40% of growth in the auto industry over the next five to seven years being the rapidly growing economies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Ford anticipates global sales to expand by 50% to 8 million vehicles by 2015 given the potential growth in Asia, mainly China and India; and rising demand for small cars. The automaker anticipates small cars to account for 55% of the total sales by 2020 compared with 48% presently. One third of the small car sales are expected to come from Asia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;In late 2012, Ford announced plans to boost exports of its engine production from India by shipping them for the first time to Europe. Currently, the automaker exports 40% of its Indian-made engines and 25% of its Indian-made cars to 35 countries. The company expects to manufacture 450,000 cars and 600,000 engines in India by 2015. It already pumped in $2 billion to build manufacturing facilities in India. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;In April this year, General Motors revealed plans to build four new plants in China in order to boost annual production capacity to 5 million vehicles and triple its exports from Chinese plants by 2015. GM and its joint venture partners in China plan to invest $11 billion in the country by 2016 as part of their major expansion program. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;In 2009, China overtook the U.S. as the biggest auto market in the world by sales volumes when the Beijing government introduced a stimulus package, including tax incentives for small cars. China accounted for a third of light vehicle sales growth in the last five years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;However, the incentives were scrapped in 2011 and the Beijing government imposed quotas on new car registrations in order to control the traffic congestions. In 2012, sales in China grew 4.3% to 19.3 million units, which is lower than the 8% growth projected by China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) as well as the double-digit growth in 2009 and 2010. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%"&gt;Auto sales in the country are expected to improve if the government renews some of its policy incentives that helped the country overtake the U.S. as the biggest auto market. According to the Chinese government, total vehicle sales in China are expected to rise 7.8% to 20.8 million vehicles in 2013 from 19.3 million last year, led by strong demand for passenger vehicles and economic recovery. The CAAM believes SUVs will remain the fastest-growing segment in the year while commercial vehicles will record a moderate gain in sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
