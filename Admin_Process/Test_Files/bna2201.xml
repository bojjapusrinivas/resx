Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Good morning, well attitude matters! today India is heading towards swach barat but we need to first analyse how many people are aware of this concept introduceed by the MODI GOVERNMENT. He introduced this in the year2015 in the month of august. Many efforts have been made to make people aware of this concept to make India clean and green but the most important thing we need to know is how well people are implementing this. The attitude of people is more important than awareness because many people may be aware of clean india but they are letargic or hesitant to implement it as few people think that their participation alone may not change India. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Clean INDIA implementation must be rooted in people`s mind. They need to know the benefits of clean india especially in rual areas we can see the amount of waste material lying on the roads. we need to make them implement this by making them aware about their participation in clean india and how people people will learn by seeing them. We have to make them aware about the prons and cons of clean india, like when their is no cleanliness how different types of gems, bacteria and viirus will cause different types of diseases and when they are poor they cannot meet the expenses to recover from the diseases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Measures should be taken by the government like establishing the waste mangment office every where in the state which is easily reachable to people so that they can dump their waste material in that insteading of wasting them or throwing on the roads. The recent incident which made me think about clean india movement is when one of the state`s government had provided with two different dustbins but the effort goes in vain when the separate bins which people have collected are dumped in one big basket! This is a best example where people are not implementiung even when they are aware of the clean india and government is least bothered about how the process/procedure&amp;nbsp;of waste managemnt is proceding. Here government should be more aware about how the waste mangemnt process is being implemented. they need to take care of every small things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Coming to urban people as almost all of them are working.The office should take care of clean india movement by keeping the weighing machine which will show the amount of wastage of employes (food in cafeteria) everyday and we need to make them more aware about this wastage of food which can help the poor people from starving and can fill a &amp;nbsp;poor man`s stomach. office premises should have a sign boards of clean india quotes. Fine can also be imposed to people who waste the food. If it is the small bits pf papers and office`s old document they can give it for recylcing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Hence I conclude saying that the attitude of people is more important because CLEANLINESS IS GODLINESS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
