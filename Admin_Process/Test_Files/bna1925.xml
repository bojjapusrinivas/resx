Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Yes, I think our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances. I hope this dependence is not good for overall development. The usage of computers is increasing tremendously now a days.Even the school children are more familiar with these computers and technologies. All the people are getting addicted to the computers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;There is no day without the usage of computers. These computers are being used right from running school, railway system etc. These are being used in every field and department. In the schools for showing the actions for rhymes teachers use computers. and for saving data of a student etc these are computers are used. For teaching purpose teachers depend on computers. With these computers many of them are getting addicted to internet.For an online reservation through train many of the people use computers.Because of its comfortability, flexibility and fastness many of the people depend on computers. Now a days students save their notes in computers and prepare for their exams.In offices for calculating and storing the financial they use computers. As these computers take less time than man power. In this way many of people are more depending on computers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; But the total dependency on the computers is good for overall development. People getting addicted to thes computers are not able to spend time with their family. They always be on computer. Beacuse of these computers and technologies the relationships and true love between people is reducing day by day. And many of the peoples creativity is not improving as most of them &amp;nbsp;search everything in the internet. Most of the children who are addicted to computers are losing their eyesight. By the age of 5years they wear spects. And because of these computers most of the children neglect their studies.There is a saying that "todays children are tommorows leaders ". If they get addicted to these computers how the children interact with others and how can they become leaders in the futre.And the usage of computers makes a man lazy.Man stops thinking.So i think the dependence on computers is not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Finally i conclude computers play vital role in our lives. The dependence on computer is increasing tremendously which is good only for an extent. The usage of computers should be limited so that people may know the value of relationships. With good relations one can develop the society. With the limited usage the people can use their creativity for the development and can be perfect. People sitting infront of computers can get the health problems. So limited usage of computers donot effect the health of a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:WorldAutoIndustryOutlookJune2013&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AutoIndustry is one of the important industry. More than 90% of the total vehicles sold in U.S. Toyato, one among the the top 10 automakers stood first by defeating the General Motors sales of 9.29 millions vehicles by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in the year 2012. And the Germany`s Volkswagen AG stood third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auto markets suppliers are facing pricing pressures and production cuts. Automakers make their main challenge to develop the suppilier networks along with shifting of production facilities to new regions. But the existing suppliers of automakers lack financial strength to expand in new markets. this leads to the pricing pressure from automakers thats constricts parts suppliers margins. On other hand auto parts suppliers are sensitive to technology transfers to local third parties. With this drawback The low cost competitors get a chance. This leads to the production cuts by automakers which negatively effect the operations of auto market. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the rising prices of fuel and global warming auto industry turned attention &amp;nbsp;to use cheaper renewable sources of energy. The U.S goverment continued effort to promote green alternatives which are good in the near future. Toyaota and Honda are &amp;nbsp;ruling the hybrid market. Other automakers such as ford , General motors and Nissan are trying to push hybrid sales.U.S is the largest hybrid car market in the world with sales accounting for 60%-70% of global hybrid sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In january 2013 Obama stated golal of puting 1 million electric cars on road by 2015 due to weaker demand for plugins. It led to DOE grant recipient to be written doen by chemical behemoth Dow Chemical. He jointly operated the entity with TK Advanced Battery LLLC since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;World Auto Industry Outlook - June 2013 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Although automakers continue to focus on shifting their production facilities to new regions driven by cost and demand factors, developing the supplier networks remains one of their greatest challenges. Existing suppliers to automakers often lack the financial strength to expand capacity in new markets. On the other hand, auto parts suppliers are sensitive to technology transfers to local third parties, which can give rise to low-cost competitors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;High dependence on automakers makes the auto market suppliers vulnerable to several maladies, primarily pricing pressure and production cuts. Pricing pressure from automakers constricts parts suppliers` margins. On the other hand, production cuts by automakers driven by frequent market adjustments negatively affect their operations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Future of Green Cars Looks Bleak &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Rising fuel prices and global warming have turned attention to the auto industry that either rely less on traditional fossil fuels or use cheaper renewable sources of energy. Despite the U.S. Government`s continued effort to promote "green" alternatives such as fuel-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles, things look bleak, at least in the near future. Globally, the hybrid market is ruled by Toyota (which includes the Prius) and Honda (includes Civic and Insight hybrids). Meanwhile, other automakers such as Ford, General Motors and Nissan are also aggressively pursuing a plan to push hybrid sales. Some of the well-recognized "green" cars include the Ford Focus, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf and Daimler AG`s ( DDAIF ) smart USA micro EV. U.S. is the largest hybrid car market in the world with sales accounting for 60%-70% of global hybrid sales. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However, the industry has witnessed some notable adverse developments in the drive for green technology. In January 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) backed off President Barack Obama`s stated goal of putting 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015 due to weaker than expected demand for plug-ins/EVs. According to Hybridcars.com, plug-in/EV sales constituted a meager 3.3% of the overall sales in the U.S. in 2012. The weak demand for plug-ins/EVs has led some lithium-ion battery makers file for bankruptcy protection in 2012. They include MA-based A123 Systems Inc. and NY-based EnerDel, despite both being DOE grant recipients (A123 - $249.1 million; EnerDel - $118.5 million). It also led another DOE grant recipient (in fact, the third largest with $161.0 million), Dow Kokam, to be written down by chemical behemoth Dow Chemical ( DOW ), who jointly operated the entity with TK Advanced Battery LLC since 2009.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
