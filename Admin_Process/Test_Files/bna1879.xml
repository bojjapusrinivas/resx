<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/25/2015 5:06:29 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic and infrastructural planning of an area should be done bearing in mind the environment conservation. To what extent do you agree with this statement? Provide reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the statement given, any organisation when planning for its economic status and infrastructure has to keep the knowledge of outside environment. The reason is an organisation will have communication with the outside world to improve its business, so that it can analysis the economic growth of itself by comparing with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain with an example, a enterprenuer want to start an organisation. First think what he/she does is to study how other organisations in the particular field are progressing. By the study he will get an idea of how the other are managing thier services, what are products they are providing, what type of infrastructure they are having, what is the economic growth of the company by providing the particular type of products and services.They may even take the feedback of the clients and customers about the products and servcies and how much they are satisfied with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analysing &amp;nbsp;the information, the enterprenuer gets an idea regarding the market, the different products and services to be provided, the infrasturcture to be designed for the company depending upon the products and services, the areas needed to be more focussed, and the organisation has to be different from existing ones. For any organisation, the main criteria will be business expansion and profits. These will be fulfilled only when you have proper communication with outside world. Communication means frequent interactions with the customers and clients. The infrasturcture should be designed in such a way where the customer should feel free to express his/her views regaring any product or service. This will improve the organisation`s good will and new customers gets attracted and steadily the businnes get expanded. Once a organisation good will improves the business increases which simultaneously improves the economic status of the organisation.One more important factor while planning an infrastructure is the employees. The organisation should provide proper amenities to their employess by which they feel to perform thier works by the time given. If an employee is not satisfied with office environment, the work assigned may not get complete and it will be a loss to the organisation which inturn leads to economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proper planning for economic and infrastructure for any organisation should be done to maintain good rapport within the employees, customers and clients for its growth as per the goals of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

India is one the fastest economies to recover from the crises because of its storng domestic fundamentals and it helped to regain the momentum of the economy at a faster pace. It is believed that India`s long term growth prospects will remain buoyant because of underlying strong macroeconomic fundamentals and on boosing the investment activity and setting up a favourable policy environment has acted as an catalyst to unravel the growth potential of the economy during the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights of the analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the Indian economy will be comparable to the Japanese economy(in terms of GDP) as of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;India`s economic growth in the current decade is expected to drive the buoyancy in service sector as the current phase growth is subdued continue till FY15 and the growth rate further increases i.e; more than US $5 trillion by FY20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the economy is accelerated, the investment activity increses from 36.6% of GDP during FY10 to 40.7% by FY20.Similarly the domestic savings rate gets increases from 33.8% during FY10 to 39.5% by FY20. The private final consumption significantly rise to 70% from 60% as of FY11. The infrastructure activity will have both cause and consequence of the growth during the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic growth drivers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social and physical infrastructure are the key growth drivers to achieve `inclusive growth` over the current decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure investment in the electricity sector is expected to 3.8% of GDP by FY20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment in physical infrastructure is expected to 11.5% of GDP by FY20 from around 6% of GDP in FY12 and it increases the employment, production efficiency, reduces cost of business and improves standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government focus towards improving overall healthcare facilitities increases to enhance the total government expenditure to 2.2% of GDP in FY20, as of 1.3% in FY12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of private sector in infrastructure finanacing increses for 39.4% in FY12 to 48% in FY20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment in agriculture sector gets increased to 3.2% of GDP bt FY20 from 2.6% of GDP in FY12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India Economic Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India remained remarkably resilient from the global economic turmoil in 2008 owing to its strong domestic fundamentals and had been one of the fastest economies to recover from the crisis. Currently, the growth momentum of the Indian economy has again been impacted. This time around besides the prevailing crisis in some of the developed economies, emergence of certain domestic issues had played a major role in restraining India&amp;rsquo;s growth momentum. However, we believe that India&amp;rsquo;s long term growth prospects will remain buoyant driven by its underlying strong macroeconomic fundamentals. We believe that emphasis on boosting investment activity and setting up of a favorable policy environment will act as a catalyst to unravel the growth potential of the Indian economy during the current decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The highlights of the analysis have been provided below &amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s macro-economic outlook 2020:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India is expected to be more than US$ 5 trillion (current market price) economy by FY20. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The size of the Indian economy will be comparable to the Japanese economy (in terms of GDP in US$) as of 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;We expect the current phase of subdued growth to continue till FY15 before the economy moves into a high growth phase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s economic growth during the current decade is expected to be driven by the buoyancy in the services sector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment activity is expected to accelerate going ahead, which will help the Indian economy achieve a higher growth rate. Share of investment to GDP will increase to stand at 40.7% of GDP during FY20 from 36.6% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Infrastructure will be both a cause and a consequence of economic growth during the current decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Strong growth in domestic savings will support domestic investment. The savings rate is expected to surge to 39.5% during FY20 from 33.8% during FY10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Under consumption, share of discretionary spending is expected to rise significantly to 70% of private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) as compared to 60.0% (P) in FY11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic growth drivers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Substantial investments in social and physical infrastructure will be the key growth drivers that will enable the economy to achieve &amp;lsquo;inclusive growth&amp;rsquo; over the current decade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Infrastructure investment in the electricity sector is expected to account for 3.8% of GDP by FY20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Investment in physical infrastructure is expected to lead to employment generation, increased production efficiency, reduction in cost of doing business and improved standard of living which is expected to drive infrastructure investment (as measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation) to 11.5% of GDP by FY20 from around 6.0% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;Increased government focus towards improving overall healthcare facilities is expected to enhance total government expenditure on healthcare to 2.2% of GDP in FY20, as against 1.3% (BE) of GDP in FY12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;times new roman&amp;#96;, times; font-size: large;"&gt;The share of the private sector in infrastructure financing is expected to increase from 39.4% in FY12 (P) to 48.0% in FY20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
