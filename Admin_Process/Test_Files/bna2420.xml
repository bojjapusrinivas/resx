&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;India is into globalisation so new technology must be used according to modernaization.In in ancient days there were no proper trasportation facility for the public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;To travel from one origin to the destination it used to take 2 to 3 days to travel.but now the era as been changed there are so many plans implemented on railways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;bullet trains or better trains-what does India need?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;According to me bullet trains can travel more faster than the normal trains.Bullet trains have so many facilities like air condition, wifi,more comfort,fast moving and more safety.For any individual safety comes first than comfort.Bullet trains are more costlier than better trains,but it provides the benefits. The normal engine train does not provide safety and comfort.As india is moving into faster pace it should go for bullet trains.The implementation of bullet trains need huge investment but the returns on that will be fruitful.In recent days India has started implementation of metro trains in all the &amp;nbsp;metropolitician city.Introducing metro in metropolitician city was good idea.As it is benefiting the public in all ways.The public can over come the hectic traffic by travelling in metro trains.The time wil be saved.And there is more comfort and safety by travelling in trains rather than chossing a road trasport.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;If we compare India with other countries then India is moving at a slow pace.As india is a developing country it takes time to bring more innovation and implementation of any project.The world has become technology oriented,every where the work is being completed with the help of technology.The evolution of IT(Information technology) in our country has brought boon in the economy.So with &amp;nbsp;help of new technolgy the implementation of bullet trains can be brought in india.For metro trains India has imported raw materials from Japan and Koreya.So with the help of importing India can become a technology oriented country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Now a days youth is playing a major role in the country.The ideas given by youth are more innovative.so the country can utilise the innovative ideas of the youth and can bring changes in the country.As years are passing there is increase in technology,cost of living and lifestyle.So every individual wants new technology and they don`t prefer old custom.As this is the case there is a need to introduce bullet trains in India.Generally bullet trains means we think of a train which goes like a "bullet",its true bullet train will run as fast as a bullet.As we are living in competitive world we need to have all the eminities like foreign countries to have a edge over competition.The idea of introducing bullet trains in the country can increase overall growth of the counrty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;So in a nutshell i can say that in all aspects bullet trains are far better than normal trains.It takes time to implement but definately the general public will have the fruits upon implementation.The government should have a proper plan and then it should take actions.with the help of engineers it can design a plan,decide the capital investment,know the risk involved in it ,barriers for implemenation and taking appropriate decision before implemenation.So finally bullet trains can bring a greater change in the economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
