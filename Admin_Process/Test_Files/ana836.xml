What according to you are the key contributions of Education in Modern Society? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that Education can really change the world. According to me the key contributions are, the parents should send their children to schools at the age of 3 as there are many play schools in this modern society. If the parents can&amp;#39;t afford to send their kids to play schools they should atleast send them to govenment schools, as the education system in government schools is changing day by day. Teachers in schools should be very proficient with all the aspects to teach these kids and make them valuable for society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that the Education should not be theoritical but should be practical. One should attain practical knowledge through different available resources. Education in this modern society has changed drastically, there are some educational institutions at present which are concentrating only on students scores, merits and percentages. One should not judge students credibility by a three hour exam, education should build practical knowledge rather than concentrating only on theoritical exams. In many foreign countries education sytem is differnt as their teaching standards are different when compared to India. Education system in India is one of the oldest system and it is changing at a rapid speed which is a very good sign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education is very important to each and every individual because it plays a vital role in building one&amp;#39;s character. One should take responsibility of teaching poor students in their free times on a voluntary basis. There are many free voluntary organizations to teach poor children which is encouraging for childrens as well as for the professionals who are looking to change the society by doing voluntary work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
