Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;At least 1 human being is dying for every 10 minutes due to lack of proper medical care. We see a lot of cases daily about this in the newspapers, news channels &amp;amp; social media. People are concerned about their own life but not that of others. This has become the worst scenario in these days. In olden days, people are concerned about each other in the whole village. In recent days, due to urbanisation; more nuclear families are being built. Even they are not caring about the family members or friends. Well wisher is the word we used to listen in those days, even this word has become less known as none of us are using it now. A person leaving this world due to unavailability of proper&amp;nbsp; medical resources is the worst thing that can happen. A death can effect many in the family.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The medical services has become a business now a days. Doctors are neither concerned of the people nor knowing the problem exactly due to lack of experience. Considering Hyderabad, there are less doctors available for a patient to approach. As there is demand for doctors, they are increasing the consultation fees which is not bearable for lower middle class and low class people. Due to this, the poor people are undertaking some cheap &amp;amp; local treatments; hence making life difficult to lead. There are many treatments like Homeopathy which are available in the market at less cost. People should be educated with this kind of treatments by celebrities like Amitabh done it for polio eradication campaign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Medical services should be made available in every village not only to give treatment for the people but also educate them to prevent the diseases.&amp;nbsp;Making them drink purified water, washing hands are some them. Even some&amp;nbsp;MNC`s are helping the people get educated about them. For example, lifebuoy launched up a campaign for educating the people to wash hands before eating. This was done by printing its slogan&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; symbol on roti`s.&amp;nbsp;By this way, Many companies can contribute their part to&amp;nbsp;make healthy&amp;nbsp;nation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Prime minister of India, Narendra Modi ji started a campaign called "Swatch Bharat" for building a clean &amp;amp; healthy nation. He started it near a police station before launching it officially in Rajput, New Delhi. If our surroundings are clean then automatically the spreading of diseases will be stopped.&amp;nbsp;Mosquitoes carry many diseases, they are grown up in stagnant water. Hence, by maintaining clean premises &amp;amp; covering the&amp;nbsp;stagnant water mosquitoes &amp;amp; also other flies population. This helps in preventing &amp;amp; eradicating many diseases. Cleanliness is next to godliness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Commercializing the medical services is good for building a healthy nation. But, it should be uniformly done across the country.&amp;nbsp;Due to this, it will be able to reach any corner of the country. Targeting fewer places &amp;amp; neglecting the remaining doesn`t make sense. If that is the case, then commercialization should not happen. If that is happening it is taking advantage by someone for something. As of now, due to lack of amenities for commercializing the medical services, it would be better to leave it as it is now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
