<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:33:59 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes&amp;nbsp; I agree that in india there is an enormous gap between healthcare and supply and even demand, that happened because there is no humanity in our&amp;nbsp;country. we see very few people are ready to take initiativeness in helping&amp;nbsp;others.what I think is &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;First of all,Indian government should provide an opportunity to the youth&amp;nbsp; to serve the nation . &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;our government gives more importance to VIP&amp;#39;S in the service than the common people,that should not be there in any area not only in the health service but we can see more in the health service area.&amp;nbsp;everyone should be treated equal.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Not only in the cities even in rural /urban areas government should take care of the people&amp;nbsp;who&amp;nbsp; need their support. Government should provide required basic facilities in the hospitals. we see many government hospitals are irresponsible that should be changed .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;we read in newspapers and&amp;nbsp; we hear in the news saying that patients are been treated outside the hospital because of no ward availability and&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;hear that&amp;nbsp; there are no basic intruments or equipment&amp;#39;s are been provided.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;People who are rich that is different, at least middle class people can manage few things and can come to cities for treatment but what&amp;nbsp;about the poor people where do they go.So&amp;nbsp;, government should keep these things in mind and do the proper service to the public.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;we can see that india is mostly corrupted keeping that point aside,people who are rich instead of wasting the money for constructing malls and hotles they can donate the money in the from of fund to the hospitals where there are no basic equipment&amp;#39;s and they can provide beds&amp;nbsp; etc., to the needed hospitals .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should pass the rule that people who are earning more than certain amount required for their family needs, there should be cut off so that the money directly goes as funds to the required use.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Government should be flexible ,that it should be able to provide good service to the country and people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It should use&amp;nbsp;the public money for public use not for its own issues.Every year they waste lot of money for unnecessary use instead of that,&amp;nbsp;the they can spend it for actual issues,there are many issues in our country to be solved.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;At last I conclude saying that&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;health is wealth&amp;quot; keeping this in mind government should work for the nation. If they provide best services to the public they will make you lead the nation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
