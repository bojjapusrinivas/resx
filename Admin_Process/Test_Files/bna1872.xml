Do you think this brain drain is making the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer? Discuss the pros and cons of brain drain, and measures to check this phenomenon? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In my point of view the qualified people from developing countries move to developed or rich countries in search of a better position,profile,work and money.Because many people want to join in developed or rich countries,they want to grow in a certain position quickely &amp;nbsp;and also the profile of that country business also will high qualified and also they will give high packages but their is more burden and also more targets to complete the work.Yes i think this is brain drain is making the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer.Because the highly qualified and greate communication skills to get a job in developed companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Then the other people can get job in a medium developed companies and they can settled in that company only or after he can get experiance then he can left for that job and join in highly developed compinies.So i think the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer.Many people can join in any medium company then after getting 1 year experiance they can leave for that company and join in developed company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The pros of brain drain is to joing as a fresher to get a more practicle experiance and high packages.And we will get a more knowledge about the organisation.In that we will get more efficient work in some companies and to have good facilities,infrastructure and etc.And the economic value can grow fast in joing in the developed countries and in a better poisition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The cons of brain drain is as above said that the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer.Many people are to join in the developed country but they didnot get experiance as a freshers.Only the developed countries can running fastly and also growing fastly and the medium countries can`t developed fastly,because every one decided to join in develpoed countries but they don`t think about the medium countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;I conclude that i &amp;nbsp;think the brain drain is to making rich country richer and poor country poorer.Because every person think that they can join in highly developed countries like USA,Australia and etc.This is effect on the non developed countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:WorldAutoIndustryOutlookJune2013&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the above passage says that the auto industry is highly concentrated in producing high number of products in globally.The top 10 global auto makers account roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vechicle sold in the U.S.And in the first rank to selling the vehicles globally is Toyota with 9.75 million vechicles globally in 2012 and second,third position goes to GM`s sales of 9.29 million vechicles and next Germany`s Volkswagen sales of 9.07 million vechicles for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Althogh they selling vehicles highly in the global they can continue to focus on the shifting their production facilities to new regions driven by cost and demand factors,developing the supplier networks remaiuns one of their greatest challenges.And they think about the pricing presure from automakers constricts parts suppliers margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the auto industry to plan that to manufacture Green cars to save the global warming and also U.S Government`s continued effort to promote green alternatives such as fuel-efficient electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles,things look bleak.atleast in the near future.And some companies &amp;nbsp;that is Honda,Ford,General motors and Nissan are also aggressively pursuing &amp;nbsp;a plan to push hydrid sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; U.S. is the largest hybrid car market in the world with sales accounting for 60%-70%of global hybrid sales.The president Obama`s stated goal of putting 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015.The demand of the plug-ins/EVs is weak,because it has led some lithium-ion battery makers file for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auto makers companies palnning to Manufacturing Green cars to control the global warming and the goverment also t6o support that to produe the Green cars in globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;World Auto Industry Outlook - June 2013 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Although automakers continue to focus on shifting their production facilities to new regions driven by cost and demand factors, developing the supplier networks remains one of their greatest challenges. Existing suppliers to automakers often lack the financial strength to expand capacity in new markets. On the other hand, auto parts suppliers are sensitive to technology transfers to local third parties, which can give rise to low-cost competitors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;High dependence on automakers makes the auto market suppliers vulnerable to several maladies, primarily pricing pressure and production cuts. Pricing pressure from automakers constricts parts suppliers` margins. On the other hand, production cuts by automakers driven by frequent market adjustments negatively affect their operations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Future of Green Cars Looks Bleak &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Rising fuel prices and global warming have turned attention to the auto industry that either rely less on traditional fossil fuels or use cheaper renewable sources of energy. Despite the U.S. Government`s continued effort to promote "green" alternatives such as fuel-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles, things look bleak, at least in the near future. Globally, the hybrid market is ruled by Toyota (which includes the Prius) and Honda (includes Civic and Insight hybrids). Meanwhile, other automakers such as Ford, General Motors and Nissan are also aggressively pursuing a plan to push hybrid sales. Some of the well-recognized "green" cars include the Ford Focus, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf and Daimler AG`s ( DDAIF ) smart USA micro EV. U.S. is the largest hybrid car market in the world with sales accounting for 60%-70% of global hybrid sales. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However, the industry has witnessed some notable adverse developments in the drive for green technology. In January 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) backed off President Barack Obama`s stated goal of putting 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015 due to weaker than expected demand for plug-ins/EVs. According to Hybridcars.com, plug-in/EV sales constituted a meager 3.3% of the overall sales in the U.S. in 2012. The weak demand for plug-ins/EVs has led some lithium-ion battery makers file for bankruptcy protection in 2012. They include MA-based A123 Systems Inc. and NY-based EnerDel, despite both being DOE grant recipients (A123 - $249.1 million; EnerDel - $118.5 million). It also led another DOE grant recipient (in fact, the third largest with $161.0 million), Dow Kokam, to be written down by chemical behemoth Dow Chemical ( DOW ), who jointly operated the entity with TK Advanced Battery LLC since 2009.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
