What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in City is Obviously a big Plus point and scores more over the rural counterpart. The facilities such as good education , exposure to different levels of environment makes the brain grow and that&amp;nbsp;helps in &amp;nbsp;the growth of the human being. There are scores of educational institutions in city that provide us different courses, which enables us to choose the courses in accordance with our interest and aptitude. In this way we can reach our career goals and fullfil our dreams. In rural areas there is scarce of employment as there is no proper infrastructure , no proper planning of the villages, small &amp;nbsp;towns and Lack of funds combined with zero Guidance makes the upbringing difficult for a person .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In rural areas there is exploitation to the fullest as people are uneducated and the so called authorities that includes Village sarpanch , MLAS ruin people&amp;#39;s lives by making use of False propaganda and agendas. They use people&amp;#39;s naive nature to their advantage. A person gets reasonable justice only when he gets proper education. This helps him to overgrow of his naive mentality and horizon his thinking and mindset.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The steps taken to decrease the disparity is to educate the people of rural areas and also develop the rural areas . We can take example of our state Andhra Pradesh . We can develop the districts of Telangana, like Adilabad, Nizamabad. It helps as people of Telangana can choose between their own districts for education and employment . This way state grows as well as the districts. Proper usage of Funds is&amp;nbsp; a must and people must unite to pressurize the government in administration, as there could proper division of funds alloted to the required districts. As the districts will grow , investors will come to invest their money in the rural areas. Once there is investment, Industry will grow and make it reach a reasonable level. This will help in proper segregation of the state. Hence people have better standards of living. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;But all the above mentioned can be achieved only we keep plans for long term development. And it is a slow and steady process. We must be patient and consistent enough to achieve the goals. Also whatever government policies exist &amp;nbsp;regarding education must be fullfilled at any cost . Only Education enlightens the person to achieve his basic rights and needs. Once he achives this basic thing, he will evolve and grow further.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Thank You &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
