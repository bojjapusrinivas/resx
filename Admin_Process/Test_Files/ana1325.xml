The main reason is Economy But the present Indian economy is very much better than last ten years ago. There are some things which changes the economy. those are, Dollar rate, gold rate, imports and exports and unemployment etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;The above points are played an important role in development of a country. If we see our country economy not in stable state. The reason behind this, compare to previous years there is much difference between imports and exports. When the imports are high compare to exports it shows decrease&amp;nbsp;the value of economy. Unemployment also plays an&amp;nbsp;important role in economy. if the employment increases&amp;nbsp;it shows some good results in economy. And&amp;nbsp;other things like rates of things.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;According to my knowledge there are some concepts to implement for&amp;nbsp;good economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;Those concepts are:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;Controlling Black Money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;Providing Employment to Youth&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;Providing or Encourage Small Scale Industries&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;Providing education to all. By doing this every one knows the economy related matters.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;Encourage to Exports and try to decrease import quantities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;Educate&amp;nbsp;the people to investments.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;Government has to take care of the things which changes economy like&amp;nbsp;taxes etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;Black money is one of the main problem to Indian economy. The main source for black money is Corruption. Government has to take serious action on corruption.&amp;nbsp;From the last two years&amp;nbsp;we saw so&amp;nbsp;many scams.&amp;nbsp;If the government success on this, we can see the large development in Indian economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;Apart from these things government has to implement new schemes to Formers and industries. Because these two sectors are plays an important role in&amp;nbsp;Indian economy.&amp;nbsp;The main problem is most of the people don&amp;#39;t know about Economy and it&amp;#39;s related things. If we provide or educate them we can change our economy. If these things follows we can reach good status or good economy and also we can also get good rank in the world.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;If we see other counties like US or Uk, we can find some good schemes to improve Economy. But we can&amp;#39;t implement those things in India. The main reason is Population. The government also focus on population. Population also plays an important role in economy either directly or indirectly. Due to high population government also unable to find schemes. if they starts any new schemes they are phasing problem&amp;nbsp;with implementation or maintaining&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;I feel that above mentioned reasons and suggestions are help to country to develop Economy.&amp;nbsp;My suggestion is that the new government has to take compulsory actions to increase economy. May this government will do this because it was formed by self parliament members. So it can take any action and it can be easily implement it with out any disturbances from other alliance parties.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="times new roman,times" size="2"&gt;I wish that in next five years we can tell that &amp;quot;Indian is one of the developed country in the world&amp;quot;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
