What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In India&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the Healthcare System is still in developing stage.. There are many healthcare centres,out of which most of them are private. Poverty is the most important issue prevailing in India.Today,most of the people&amp;nbsp;are unable to treat&amp;nbsp;their disease in private hospitals dur to poverty.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I think there&amp;nbsp; is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand.Though, there are&amp;nbsp;many government hospitals in the country,they do not have many scanning machiches. Hence the government should take necessary steps to improve the patient care in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The first and foremost thing the government has to do is to establish&amp;nbsp;the healthcare centres not only in urban areas but also in rural areas. Then they should&amp;nbsp;focus on availability of&amp;nbsp;doctors specialized in various areas and should ensure abundant&amp;nbsp;scanning machines&amp;nbsp;for the surgical purposes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The healthcare centres are&amp;nbsp;providing many services to patients and at the same time demanding their needs to be fulfilled by the government like reducing taxes leveid on them,loan facilities from banks,more vehicles for the ambulance services,increements in wages levels of every employee.Hospitals should provide insurance services for the patients and should provide emergency services without any obligations. The government should also ensure that the whitecard holders should be provided a good service by healthcare centres &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Finally,I would like to conclude that government should develop and provide enough services for both the healthcare centres operating in public and private sector and thus improving the patient care in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
