Ethics in sports basically means that unfair practices like match fixing, betting shoul be stopped. Sports is an important part of our nation. In India, Cricket is the only sport for which every Indian has curiousity to watch. People are interested in many other sports like bad minton, football, volleyball but every street has some small cricketers playing cricket as thier daily routine. Uethical practices such as betting and match fixing has led many of houses shutter down and many dreams left broken. Match fixing is to fix the match that certain player will only run certain number of runs and then he will be out. Betting on other hand is to bet certain amount of money for which country should win. These practices are followed for cricket match. Ethics in sports requires these practices to be stopped by following strict norms against them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As per latest news, many of celebrities and cricketers were engage in match fixing during IPL matches. These crimes can be stopped by making more srict rules and punishement for the persons charged in the respective cases.&amp;nbsp;In my&amp;nbsp;opinion betting should not be legalised for IPL as if it will legalised then their will be no fear of being caught&amp;nbsp;and every person will start betting&amp;nbsp;even if he does not have that much money to return if he loses the bet. Many house will be&amp;nbsp;broken because of betting. Betting&amp;nbsp;should be make a crime instead of that, and also strict punishements shuold be given to persons who caught&amp;nbsp;betting. If this will be followed than only we can avoid recent atch fixing scams. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Ethics in sports should be followed by playing for the country, its people, not for money. Money is the only greed which spoils career of many people. Therefore, certain ethical norms which means following fair practices at playing should be followed. This can help us to avoid many illegal things.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
