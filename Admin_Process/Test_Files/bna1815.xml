Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is necessary to commercialize the medical services because there are many people out there, who doesn`t have an idea about what is&amp;nbsp;happening around them .If u consider the recent example there are many people suffering from swine flu in Hyderabad city and they found a vaccine for it a month ago. But many people doesn`t know about it and &amp;nbsp;it is the responsibility of the citizens to spread the news through word of mouth but many people didn`t care doing that because they are so much&amp;nbsp;bothered about oneself and not others.&amp;nbsp;People should have concern and they should take initiative in telling the people about the medical services. Because there are many diseases which&amp;nbsp; are contagious and which spread through air,water and someone can stop it only&amp;nbsp;by educating others. So that they will be cautions and take necessary actions&amp;nbsp; to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; These days we find the different diseases and virus in every part of the world and mainly in India and we could say that the main reason for it is the filthy surroundings. And Swatch Bharath is one of the initiative started by Modi`s government to prevent diseases like this and keep the surroundings clean. But many people were not serious about it they took initiative of this program just to upload the pictures and status in Facebook and they are really not concerned about others. There are many medical services which are not known to many people especially backward society and rural people who doesn`t have access to the media .So we should educate those people by arranging medical camps and try all the possible ways to reach them and educate them regarding the diseases and what all medical services are available to them to prevent those diseases to be in a safe zone. There are few people who give much importance to wealth and not health. Forget about the others well being, these people are not concerned with their own health. They should keep in mind that nothing is possible if you`re&amp;nbsp; not in good health and fit. People can achieve anything only if they are in good health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is definitely necessary to commercialize the medical services, and people should also be concerned about others because they should also keep in mind that the neighbours or colleagues health might also&amp;nbsp;show impact on your own&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; health&amp;nbsp;if it is contagious&amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;we can make better and healthy India only if we commercialize the medical services.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
