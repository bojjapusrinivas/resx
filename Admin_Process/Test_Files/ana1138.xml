<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:34:13 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;but when there is nothing left to left to take away&amp;quot; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The most singificant part in human life is played by health and hygein. In an over populated country like India the living conditions of common man play a crucial role which reflect the performance and future of the country. But it is an underlying fact that there is an enorrmous gap between the demand and supply of health care in India.&amp;nbsp;Statistics and surveys always reveal the desolate fact that people in need os health care and treatment are deprived from getting proper care and attention.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Inspite of being accomplished with multi specialities and government health care centers in each part of the country, still there is no&amp;nbsp;harm in saying that common man&amp;nbsp;is deprived from health care.&amp;nbsp;The major governing reason behind this is that&amp;nbsp;most the hospitals and&amp;nbsp;health care centers are&amp;nbsp;being commercial&amp;nbsp;and not&amp;nbsp;service oriented in nature, there is a shortage of well specialised doctors and technical experts.The major alarming reason for this is most of the effecient doctors get immigrated to developed countries for better oppurtunities.&amp;nbsp;The requirement aspect of health and support is not met by the country&amp;nbsp;inspite of formulating good governing bodies to take care of health care support&amp;nbsp;by the goverment.Also the&amp;nbsp;burden of high fee structure in the field of medicine is an alarming factor.&amp;nbsp;Flaws in&amp;nbsp;framing policies, strategies and sytematic&amp;nbsp;supervision have been the&amp;nbsp;resonsive factors for this&amp;nbsp;inconsolable problem.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The immediate steps to be taken by the government to improve the health care should include the fisrt and foremost step as increasing the number of doctors and health care proffessionals. this is possible by giving education to the students in the field of medicine at a comparitively lower range so that even common people could afford to take education to become well specialsed doctors. the remuneration syatem to the doctors in India should be well improvised to stop the problem of &amp;quot;BRAINDRAIN&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;in the country.The hard core fact that the number of hospitals&amp;nbsp;in rural and semi-urban areas is&amp;nbsp;significantly low when compared to the urbanised regions is to be taken into lime light by the governmant and it has to ensure measures to improve the number of health care centers and qualified doctors in such regions.Also the policies and strategies framed by the government with respect to health care must be improvised to focus on free and&amp;nbsp;effective health care support to specially the sector of people below the poverty line.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In the present scenario, the requirement for health care is tremoundously increasing due to the destroyiong factors like pollution,&amp;nbsp;alchohol consumption,&amp;nbsp;radiations caused due to the excess use of technology and many such reasons.&amp;nbsp;Stastistical analysis reveals that&amp;nbsp;the number of patients&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;drastically increasing year after year but the health care system remaining almost the same.&amp;nbsp;This however has to be changed and improvement in the living conditions of the people has to taken care which is possible&amp;nbsp;only through government policiies and implimentations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Though government has&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;framed out plocies like free health care in many regions, the social evils like corruption and frauds in government offices have made them a major failure. For this reason, a srtict ang effecient supervising body must be established to look into the loopholes in the system and take immediate corrective actions whenever needed.All possible preventive measures must be adopted to protect the common people from being exploited by the multi specialities and health care centers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Hence government should ensure the the demand for health care is met by the country&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the quality of health care and diagnosis offered by the health care units is good enough to improve the living conditions of people. to conclude with &amp;quot;health is wealth&amp;#39; and the health of the society reflectS the performance of the country there by the the FUTURE OF THE NATION.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
