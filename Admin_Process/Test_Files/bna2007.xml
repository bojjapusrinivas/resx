&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Organizations that understand the significance of this advancement are able to adapt to such technological changes quickly and gain competitive edge in the market. Many growing companies have already foreseen the merits of such technologies and have successfully implemented them to the advantage of both the company and its employees. Some of the highlighted merits of technological advancements include: Better working conditions to the employees at their own homes , Flexible timings that enable the employees to perform their assigned tasks as per their convinience which would in-turn increase their work performance and results.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"&gt;The employees of such organizations gain more exposure about their work, constantly engage themselves in the learning process with the use of virtual media and can connect with their co-workers or superiors through telecommunications or over the virtual windows in order to clarify doubts in their tasks. Employees will continue to serve with the same organization for a longer duration and this facility enables the employers to minimize their issues of employee turnover to a large extent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"&gt;However, there are a few drawbacks about working from home. Direct communication among employees, co-workers, superiors or the employer does not exist. Technological advancements are most of the times a boon to a company but, when such technologies face issues of temporary&amp;nbsp;breakdown or system&amp;nbsp;failure the entire work process of the organization comes to a standstill. Also, the employees working from home would miss out on face-to-face interactions with their team. This would lead to miscommunications among workers and give scope to conflicts.Eventually, the employees working from home end up lacking motivation if the same work is assigned to them for a longer duration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;"&gt;Therefore, Organizations need to come up with a perfect combination of technological advancements and other resources in order to attain a competitive edge, establish new markets and experience a high market position while keeping their employees happy and satisfied at the same time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Major contributions in this industly accounting to 40% of this growth would be from China and India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;The rising demand for small cars in Asia, mainly China and India has lead Ford to anticipate the global sales to expand from 50% to 8 million vehicles by 2015. &amp;nbsp;The automaker anticipates small cars to account for 55% of the total sales by 2020 compared with 48% presently. One third of the small car sales are expected to come from Asia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;In late 2012, Ford announced plans to boost exports by shifting its engine production from India to Europe for the first time. Currently, Ford exports 40% of its indian-made engines and 25% of indian made cars to 35 countries. The company expects to manufacture 450,000 cars and 600,000 engines in India by 2012 and had already invested in 2$ billion to build manufacturing facilities in India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"&gt;In April this year, General Motors revealed plans to build four new plants in China in order to boost annual production capacity to 5 million vehicles and triple its exports from Chinese plants by 2015. GM and its joint venture partners in China plan to invest $11 billion in the country by 2016 as part of their major expansion program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"&gt;In 2009, China overtook the U.S. as the biggest auto market in the world by sales volumes when the Beijing government introduced a stimulus package, including tax incentives for small cars. China accounted for a third of light vehicle sales growth in the last five years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"&gt;However, the incentives were scrapped in 2011 and the Beijing government imposed quotas on new car registrations in order to control the traffic congestions. In 2012, sales in China grew 4.3% to 19.3 million units, which is lower than the 8% growth projected by China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) as well as the double-digit growth in 2009 and 2010.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"&gt;Auto sales in the country are expected to improve if the government renews some of its policy incentives that helped the country overtake the U.S. as the biggest auto market. According to the Chinese government, total vehicle sales in China are expected to rise 7.8% to 20.8 million vehicles in 2013 from 19.3 million last year, led by strong demand for passenger vehicles and economic recovery. The CAAM believes SUVs will remain the fastest-growing segment in the year while commercial vehicles will record a moderate gain in sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
