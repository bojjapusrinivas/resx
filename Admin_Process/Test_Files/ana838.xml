For investors around the world, they eye emerging countries for making their investments as they fetch good returns.

The G.D.P. growth rate of emerging and developing countries is higher then that of the developed countries. Developing countries have formed different groups like BRICKS, ASEAN, SAARC Etc., and are conducting annual meetings with their member nations to overcome the current global economic conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
