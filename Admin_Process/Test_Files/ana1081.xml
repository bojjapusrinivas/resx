This seems quiet difficult looking at the recent trends in growth rates since 2012. even the Government has come down on its expectations and set the expected growth rate to be just 7.5%, which is almost lesser than that of 2012, which was recorded as 7.8%. Many Private analysts have expected the growth to be taken place up to 8-9% but it was proved to be hard looking at the first quarter results, where a growth rate of 7.7% has been recorded. A growth rate of 7.7 in&amp;nbsp;2012 is recorded as lowest since economic reforms in China from the past 13 years. According to Premier Li Keqiang, only growth rate of lower 7% would be expected this year, which is the lowest in last two decades and indicated the China growth from now would be in a reasonable range of growth. This can be analysed that China wants to maintain a stable economic growth of around&amp;nbsp;7% as from now and if the growth continues as expected, it can make the GDP to reach double the figure as of now. Basically, it can be easily understood that this slow growth can be also attributed to decline in labour market in China, which was one of the major reasons for the success of China. Li was very optimistic in his speech and added &amp;quot;China being one of the huge markets in the world, healthy market growth can be achieved only through thorough development in various fields including technology and agriculture along with industrialisation and urbanisation&amp;quot;. But he was not tentative when all the reforms would be implemented and how. He was clear in announcement of some reforms but was not certain about most of them. As the rule of new government has just taken place, it may take time to implement all this new reforms into the system. This new regime may face risks while implementing new reforms, this risks could be in banking and manufacturing sectors, while government debt within state remains the major one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A risk in manufacturing sector stands out to be a clear obstacle while reaching a growth rate of even 7-8% due to increased labour wages, which made exports expensive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globalisation to larger extent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is looking forward to connect more deeply with the rest of world through penetration in to market by the way of various treaties and trading Blocs. One such bloc China wants to enter includes Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP), where members within the bloc can exchange goods within them through free trade. Members of this bloc includes United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. This type of blocs have even some cons attached to it. one such disadvantage is opening up of local market to international companies without or lower tariff, thus making it difficult for domestic companies to survive. But from China&amp;#39;s point of view, this can show good impact to privatize state run companies and allow private players to&amp;nbsp;compete heavily in market, thus by allowing the price of goods&amp;nbsp;to fluctuate freely along with credit. China is still awaiting for process to go long ahead for further approval as member of TPP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don&amp;#39;t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;China &amp;ndash; Economic Outlook for 2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How fast can China grow? That is the question underlying much of the discussion about China&amp;rsquo;s economy these days. Clearly, double digit growth is not in the cards and may even be a thing of the past. Growth of 7.7 percent in the first quarter was considered disappointing, and, until recently, many analysts were expecting growth to revert to the range of 8&amp;ndash;9 percent. Yet now the government appears determined to reset expectations. The government has forecast that growth this year will be 7.5 percent, a good deal lower than many private analysts had forecast only recently. That is certainly slower than the 7.8 percent growth in 2012, which was the slowest rate of growth in 13 years. Premier Li Keqiang, in a recent speech in Germany, said that growth for the remainder of the decade will average an even lower 7.0 percent per year. Although far slower than the growth experienced during the past two decades, Li indicated that China is &amp;ldquo;entering a range of reasonable growth.&amp;rdquo; Given that China has become a more mature economy with a declining labor force, Li is probably correct in setting more modest expectations. Moreover, growth of 7.0 percent is not bad: It doubles the GDP in 10 years. Li said that a combination of industrialization, urbanization, improvements in agricultural productivity, and investments in technology can contribute to healthy growth, and that this requires more market-oriented reforms. He also said that &amp;ldquo;for a very big economy, this is not easy.&amp;rdquo; When and how such reforms will be implemented remains uncertain. While some reforms have been announced, many government statements have been relatively vague. With a new regime just installed, it could take some time to build the support necessary to implement much needed reforms. In the interim, China faces some risks, including the ramifications of large local government debt, considerable leverage in the shadow banking system, and weaker-than expected manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing weakness stems from weakness in export markets. In addition, rising wages in China are having an adverse impact on export competitiveness, thereby leading to an exodus of manufacturing capacity. Thus, even growth in the range of 7&amp;ndash;8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further global integration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves China&amp;rsquo;s economic relationship with the rest of the world. China&amp;rsquo;s government now says it will study the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP), an effort to create a free-trade area in the Pacific Basin. Currently there are 12 countries involved in this effort: the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. If China joins the group, the TPP will collectively account for more than half of global GDP. Freer trade would entail not simply lowering tariffs and quotas, although this would be an important component. It would also involve freeing up domestic markets so that they would have to compete freely with foreign companies. From China&amp;rsquo;s perspective, this could be a positive development in that it would create pressure to privatize state-run companies, create a level playing field for the private sector, and allow free movement of prices of goods and credit. Still, agreement on the TPP is probably a long way off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
