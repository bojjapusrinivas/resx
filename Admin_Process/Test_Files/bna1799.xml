Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now a days the technology increases day by day , according to that who all are working in the IT companies have obesity problems, not only that they &amp;nbsp;are getting the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;long sight , back bone pains. basically companies are providing the facilities like gym, but they have to see the how the employees are utilizing the facilities. based on the above reasons if they didnt perform well, it will be affected to the organisation . so what ever the organisation they have to take care about the performane of the employees. not only the organisation , people has to take care of themselfs. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This is no only for the IT sector but also to the every human being, there should be some exercise daily like walking, yoga, surya namaskaram. by this they can gain more energy whole the day. but the people now are very irresponsable , they are preffering thair happiness coming to swineflu , every one some in hyderabad only in every 100 persons 5 people are affected by that disease , as a human being we have to suggest to wear the mask. basically it is affected by the pigs. so atleast we a have to forward the message that what are all the symtoms for that disease. there are so many service organisations that are freely providing vacsination to swinefle , we have to pass on the message to our frends. or who are all giving free vacsination shout promote the sevice. acccoding to me there shoud be more concern about the others , there no need to help like giving money , it should be like morel support and the ginving appropriate information aout thrt particular disease and the particular medical service. we are the human beings we have to help ourselfs and there should concern about the others beasuse they are also human beings like us .these are the oppsitives. coming to thenegitive side of the situation if we didnt worn them it will affect us . not only to us it will affect our family, this our earth we have take care abot our sand. in every any mythlogy thse are the line that every book has that is what we are doing it will be reflected back that is if we are doing good to any one it wil be good to us. if it bad means it will be bad to us . no only in mytholotgies it is also approved accoding to nerwtons third law that is for every action there is equal and opposite reaction. at last my suggestion is that be honest,be clear,care about the society.and care abot your self.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
