To what extent do you agree with this statement? Provide reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;I totally agree with the statement that Economic and infrastructural planning of an area should be done bearing in mind the environment conservation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Many cities in developing countries are built without proper infrastructural planning and they became concrete jungle without greenary. Because of this they face many problems such as air, water and sound pollution. Without proper infrastructural planning, an area can not be developed to its extent. It may face economic difficulties such as insufficient power, water and labour resources. Manufacturing firms can not find proper resources and enough area away from living area. Transportation facilities like rail, road and air services connecting whole area can not be provided without proper economic and infrastructural planning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Environment conservation is the main objective of economic and infrastructural planning of an area. As forest areas are being reduced day by day, we are facing many envronment related issues such as global warming i.e high temperatures, renewable resources are being depleted fast and becoming irrenewable. Greenary is decreasing everywhere and it leads to more air pollution and we face respiration problems. Everyday number of vehicles on the roads is increasing and without proper infrastructural planning, there will be traffic problems and valuable time is lost and we are exposed to air pollution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Many services like water supply, power, road connectivity and drainage system, etc. can not be available to all the people in an area without proper economic and infrastructural planning. And the people living in that area may face many problems in the coming years as population in increasing rapidly and it might not be able to serve to the future generations effectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;So, economic and infrastructural planning of an area should be done by mainly focussing on environment conservation. The cities should be developed with proper infrastructural planning such that it can serve the future generations effectively. The infrastructural planning should give importance to the environment by facilitating greenary covering the whole area so that people can enjoy the greenary and sound and air pollution can be reduced. The infrastructural planning allows an area to have efficient road and rail connectivities. To develop an area environment friendly and economically sound, infrastructural planning with focus on environment conservation is very important. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013AutoIndustryOutlookforAsia&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Among the Asian countries, China and India are the rapidly growing economies. In the next five to seven years, they are expected to account for 40% of growth in the auto industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;By 2015,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;Ford anticipates that &amp;nbsp;global sales will expand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;by 50% to 8 million vehicles considering the potential growth in Asia, mainly China and India. And there is increasing demand for small cars as these countries are mostly covered with middle class families. Hence, the automaker anticipates that present 48% of total sales share of small cars will increase to 55% of total sales by 2020. One third of sales of small cars is expected to come from Asia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;General Motors revealed plans in April this year to build four new plants in China to increase annual production capacity to 5 million vehicles and triple its exports from Chinese plants by 2015. GM and its joint venture partners in China are planning to invest $11 billion in China by 2016 as part of their expansion program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;China overtook the U.S. as the biggest auto market in the world by sales volumes in 2009 when the Beijing government introduced a stimulus package which includes tax incentives for small cars. China is responsible for a third of light vehicle sales growth in the last five years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;But in 2011, the Beijing government scrapped incentives and imposed quotas on new car registrations to control the traffic congestions. In 2012, in China, sales grew 4.3% to 19.3 million last year, led by strong demand for passenger vehicles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 - Auto Industry Outlook for Asia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Asia Promises High Growth &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The Asian countries, especially China and India, are expected to account for 40% of growth in the auto industry over the next five to seven years being the rapidly growing economies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Ford anticipates global sales to expand by 50% to 8 million vehicles by 2015 given the potential growth in Asia, mainly China and India; and rising demand for small cars. The automaker anticipates small cars to account for 55% of the total sales by 2020 compared with 48% presently. One third of the small car sales are expected to come from Asia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In late 2012, Ford announced plans to boost exports of its engine production from India by shipping them for the first time to Europe. Currently, the automaker exports 40% of its Indian-made engines and 25% of its Indian-made cars to 35 countries. The company expects to manufacture 450,000 cars and 600,000 engines in India by 2015. It already pumped in $2 billion to build manufacturing facilities in India. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In April this year, General Motors revealed plans to build four new plants in China in order to boost annual production capacity to 5 million vehicles and triple its exports from Chinese plants by 2015. GM and its joint venture partners in China plan to invest $11 billion in the country by 2016 as part of their major expansion program. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In 2009, China overtook the U.S. as the biggest auto market in the world by sales volumes when the Beijing government introduced a stimulus package, including tax incentives for small cars. China accounted for a third of light vehicle sales growth in the last five years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However, the incentives were scrapped in 2011 and the Beijing government imposed quotas on new car registrations in order to control the traffic congestions. In 2012, sales in China grew 4.3% to 19.3 million units, which is lower than the 8% growth projected by China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) as well as the double-digit growth in 2009 and 2010. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the country are expected to improve if the government renews some of its policy incentives that helped the country overtake the U.S. as the biggest auto market. According to the Chinese government, total vehicle sales in China are expected to rise 7.8% to 20.8 million vehicles in 2013 from 19.3 million last year, led by strong demand for passenger vehicles and economic recovery. The CAAM believes SUVs will remain the fastest-growing segment in the year while commercial vehicles will record a moderate gain in sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
