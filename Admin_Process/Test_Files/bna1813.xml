Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Thank you for giving the opportunity to share my thought about the given topic. In my point view the commercialization of medical services is good upto a certain extent because its a economical factor that impact to the health sector. Health sector in any country is not a revenue generating sector. This sector don`t generate revenue for the nation which impact to fiscal deficit. But as health sector or medical care is a priority sector for any nation the government have to give prime focus on it. Government provides basic medical facilities to the lower segment of &amp;nbsp;people. The Indian govt. have a individual ministry for the women and their health. Like wise govt. is providing the basic health facilities to all of the citizen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;But there are some segment of people who are willing spend alot for there health as well as for their fitness. For them govt. hospitals are not well enough. They are ready to spend anything for it. But the problem is government can not afford quality equipment for some deaseses where some private organization provide those facilities to that segment of people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;When we consider all segment of people altogether every one is able to spend money for their basic health problem. But for some special kind of health problem a specialist hospital or medical care is preferable. As the population of the nation is very high is it not possible for the govt. to provide all the facilities in one roof and make it multi-specialist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Here some of private organization comes to picture. Those organization have the financial strength to porovide those high quality mediacal equipment,specialist doctors,nurses and value added services. They have the strategy to provide services for upper class or upper middle class people whon don`t hesitate to spend money for their health. After the FDI allowed in health sector now it is easy to start a hospital for anyone. And this plan is benificiary for the govt. as they can collect tax from those hospitals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;But government is not so crual to avoid those lower segment of people. The health ministry have various programs to serve those segment of people. For e.g Below Poverty Line(BPL) families have the right to treat them self at any government hospital for free of cost. Also government is providing health insurance for them. After 100 percent allowance of FDI in health care sector now govt. is able to provide some free medicine to the lower class people via various NGOs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Comming to private organizations due to very high expenses occured to set up such hospitals they charges more to their patients. Also,due presence of a good no of hospitals, private organization has started charging more which is seems to be expensive for some segment of people. On the other hand i can say that due to a competetive market place the private organizations have started commercializing the medical services. And it is not about the necessity of citizen now everyone is concern about their lives at any cost.This is the way private organizations taking advantages of the market situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Finally, i would like to conclude that allowing FDI in health care sector is positive for the govt. as well as for the citizen but every opportunity comes with a cost. In this case commercialization is leading by some private playes. So to keep balance between those govt. have to provide health care facilities for the lower segment of people for a subsidies price and allowing the private player to serve the upper segment of people for better health care. By this way govt can manage it`s fical deficit properly by charging various taxes to private players which will be benificiary for the country in the near future. Also it can take advantages of FDI by employing people in various health care sector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
