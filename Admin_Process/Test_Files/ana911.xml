Developed economies in the world now became large debtor economies. In this situation economic performance of these developing and emerging countries is most important than any to prevent the collapse of those developd nations and to uplift the world economy from current recession of falling incomes and raising unemployment rate.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;as these developed nations have large trade deficits with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;&amp;nbsp;developing and growing nations like china, and tiger &amp;amp; cub economies of south east asian countries, confidence of china, cub and tiger economies of south east asia in econonomic performance of united states and europian countries is vital for these countries to come out of recession that resulted by inefficient working of monetary systems which led to financial crisis in the period of the second half of the first decade of 21st century as these developed nations have large trade deficits with these nations. though india had negative trade balance unlike other developing and growing economies that are mentioned above, controlled and efficient monetary sytem prevented it from the effect of ongoing recession.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
