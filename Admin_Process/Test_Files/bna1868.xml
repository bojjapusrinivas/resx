Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers are playing a very important role in our life, they made our life easier,much simpler and at the same time they are very useful. A Computer which is called as a commonly operated machine particularly used for technical educational research. Apart from computers making our life easier ,they are also making us lazy in our day to day activities. In the past when computers where not present we had huge human resource in an organisation working in different departments, but nowadays thye evolvement of computers affected the human resource power in the organisations in the drastic way. Ever since the evolution of computers and artificial intelligence, human intelligence and their working capacity in organisations is affected badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Artificial Intelligence serves as best option when it comes to technology but at the same time it also has very adverse effects. The next step in the field of computers is robotics.the virus prone softwares which are present in the computers are considered as threats to our secret information, when it comes to safety whether it is our bank passwords or profiles in social networking sites the computers can sometimes considered not safe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;When it comes to our overall development computers dont serve as the best learning option because if completely depend on computers we definately lack creativity in our thinking and the way we pursue things.Lacking of creativity affects our individual personality. Human intelligence have the ability to think,react,understand the situation in a very effective way rather than the artificial intelligence which only knows how to accomplish a work. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The Traditional way of working which used to exist in our past had a more friendly approach, more understanding work environment,friendly team work as we used to do all the things manually but after the arrival computers, the environment in the work areas has gradually changed from having friends in an organisation to only having acquaintances as bearly know all our colleagues. Too much adaption of artificial intelligence can lead to health problems, as we all know one of the problems the world facing nowdays is the obesity.One of main reasons for obesity apart eating junk food is through computers. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Compuetrs provide us a environment where there is no physical stress but it equally provides you with the mental stress. Physical stress to some extent &amp;nbsp;is good for health. Mental stress is something which can have more adverse effects where it can lead to eyesight or the employee can become impatient in his behaviour which can increase his stress levels health wise. Too much of anything can be regarded as dangerous. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Above Article talks about the various reasons that are leading to drawbacks in an Automobile Industry,an industry which is considered as the boom is also considered as the industry which faces great losses in recent times.Most of the european automobile companies who are specialists in manufacturing the most cosliest cars in the world also faces losses as demand for cars only exists once in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automoblile Industry is considered as one of the highest revenue industries in an economic world but once the car is purchased it is used for a life time rather than buying new car each and every year. Since the lifetime of the car is forever or until it gets fully damaged, the companies are suffering to a greater extent.More than companies the franchisers of those companies in different countries or the banks which works on alloting loans for vehicles are suffered greatly.Apart from the satisfactory service provided by the automobiles the increasing use of the same old car other than buying a new one &amp;nbsp;is also regarded as the main reason of the drawback of the automobile organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employees who are working in these franchisees have a greater threat of losing their jobs if the franchisee is unable to make up any profits.Since most of the companies already using the strategy of removing the employees from work in order to work up their losses ,still so many jobs are at threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automobile industries are restricted to manufacture limited number of cars as the sales percentage has gradually dropped which can show a greater amount of loss in the creativity or their ability of innovation.Since many of the automobile industries are public limited they are forced to shut shops due to the gradual decresae in the prices of their companies shares in the stock market. The sucess of the franchisees depends upon the number of sales it had done in an an year. Failure in the selling the prescribed number of cars can make the company run into losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many banks which wholly run their business on providing loans on cars to the consumers, but ever since the lifetime usage of cars has increased even the banks have become reluctant in providing new loans to the customers.As the banks are also not providing immediate loans the customer prefers to use the old car rather than buying a new one.The manufacturers of the costliest cars in the world are somehow managing their losses apart from the manufacturers who manufacture average rated cars or more pocket friendly cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 - Auto Industry Outlook for the US and Europe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;U.S. Market Recovery &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Strong pent-up demand due to aging vehicles on the U.S. roads along with falling unemployment rate have been the key factors in driving the auto sales in the U.S. Average age of vehicles on U.S. roads increased to 11.3 years in January 2013 from 10.8 years in 2012. Banks were also friendlier as they offered greater access to loans with lower interest rates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% to the five-year high of 14.5 million vehicles in 2012. In May 2013, auto sales in the U.S. grew 8.2% to 1.44 million units while it rose 10.9% to 15.3 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted rate (SAAR) basis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Economic Crisis in Europe &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The present Eurozone financial crisis has adversely affected the operations of many global automakers, especially GM and Ford, who have a significant exposure to the market. Car sales in Europe continued to be low owing to weak consumer confidence on the back of a weak economy triggered by the crisis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;According to the European Automobile Manufacturers` Association (ACEA), car sales in Europe reached its lowest level of 12.05 million units in 2012 since 1995, indicating a year-over-year decline of 8.2% due to the sagging demand for cars, as highly indebted banks were reluctant to finance new car purchases for customers. The decline was the steepest in the highly troubled Eurozone, where car sales dipped 11.3% to roughly 9 million units, according to Reuters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Most of the major automakers in Europe are resorting to job cuts and plant closures, as it became no longer feasible for them to undertake full-fledged operations in the continent. Unemployment in the EU reached 26.5 million in Mar 2013, while the unemployment rate increased to 10.9% in the same month from 10.3% in Mar 2012. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the U.S. automakers, Ford plans to shut vehicle and component plants in the U.K. and Belgium in the next two years while General Motors would suspend car production at its Bochum plant in Germany -- which employs 3,100 workers -- in 2016. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the European automakers, Renault plans to retrench 7,500 jobs in France by 2016 while each of Fiat and Peugeot has decided to eliminate 1,500 jobs. Among the Japanese automakers, Honda announced plans to terminate 800 jobs at its South Marston plant near Swindon, southwest England in the second quarter of 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
