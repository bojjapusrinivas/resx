<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/30/2014 4:21:07 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the demand for foreign brands overtaken that for our home grown brands? How do Indian brands fare internationally in the era of globalization?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As of we know foreign brands have been overtaking in our Country. Most of the people&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;supporting the foreign brand only by&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;brand&amp;nbsp;name&amp;quot; at the same time the foreign brands have been maintaining the quality of the good, just based on the brand name people are doesn&amp;#39;t think to spend more price to purchase the good, sop the demand of the foreign brands increasing.&amp;nbsp;The main&amp;nbsp;problem is most of the educated people thinking like there is no&amp;nbsp;proper quality in Indian brands. Even though Indian brands have been trying to give the best&amp;nbsp;with the&amp;nbsp;resources which we can get&amp;nbsp;but Indian brands doesn&amp;#39;t getting the result of their expectations. China brands&amp;nbsp;also dominating our country even by&amp;nbsp;producing low quality goods how it works mean China brands&amp;nbsp;maintaining low price.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; For example now a days every person maintaining mobile phones. The price of&amp;nbsp;a Apple company&amp;nbsp;mobile is Rs 50000. Samsung company&amp;nbsp;also introducing a mobile with same features which are in Apple mobile&amp;nbsp;at Rs&amp;nbsp;30000. China company mobiles are introducing the same features mobile at Rs 18000, and Indian company LAVA have been trying to introduce same features mobile but not yet succeeded.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; Now most of the people are interested to purchase foreign brand mobiles because the brand and demand. In India 99% of the people are using foreign mobiles. So, the demand usually increases.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Indian are intelligent but Indians have been working for foreigners. Even the CEO of Microsoft also Indian. Indians are using their knowledge for foreigners.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now the value of INR is also very low while comparing with all other countries. The foreigners are influencing us in all the way.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Indian brands have been maintaining the quality as per our standards it is fine but where foreign brands maintain the good quality which are overtaking the Indian brands. People doesn&amp;#39;t stop to purchase the foreign brands and we can&amp;#39;t stop the production of foreign brands. Instead of thinking is a wrong way better to produce&amp;nbsp;Indian goods with high quality with best price then Indian brands should dominate the foreign brands.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The fare of Indian brands is high with low quality where the foreign brands fare is very high with high quality. In such a situation also some&amp;nbsp;Indian brands are&amp;nbsp;having more demand at foreign brands. The best example is seeds.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;In some&amp;nbsp;goods Foreign brands usually thinks about money so they are producing the high quality goods and also getting high profits. Where as Indian brands are thinking about the situation of the Indians, so Indian brands producing high quality goods with&amp;nbsp;appropriate price. The best example is clothes. Even though Indian brand clothes having more demand in some foreign countries.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The last but not the least is &amp;quot;instead of thinking like foreign brands are overtaking Indian brands better to think about how&amp;nbsp;Indian brands will&amp;nbsp;overtakes foreign brands&amp;quot;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
