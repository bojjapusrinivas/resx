To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;Everywhere in the world mass media is playing major role in this competitive world. Our economy has changed, main barriers to communication has been trashed out, our knowldge is our power, as experiences are building blocks for growth, media makes us knowldgible human beings on our planet. As Technology changes media is becoming more and more powerful tool to educate people from discripencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Media has both advantages and disadvantages. It is beneficial when it is taken in the positive way. It is harmful when one focuses on nagative attributes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;TELEVISION :Now a days Television is playing more and more important role at our homes. It has shifted its catogary from luxury to neccesity. Its a stress releiver to some people, entertainer to some, news flasher to some, educational to others. But every person need to know the impotance of time and neccesity to have a television at home. Most of the house wives waste their time watching brain hammering serials. They themself educate by watching useful channels like News, sports etc. &amp;nbsp;so that, they can educate whole family. Parents can opt educational channels for their children. News channels apart from providing updations some times create unneccesary agitations among the people. Entertainment channels are in such a critical condition that a parent cannot watch in front children. Unethical, cultureless and vulgarity are exposed tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;Radio: Radio is always a news spreading media and entertainer. It is useful, in my opinoin government has to take steps in upgrading, in reaching people further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;News paper: In good olden days news paper used to be a common man&amp;#39;s ASTRAM. But now a days we can see more advertisements and less news. There are very few newspapers like THE HINDU are informative and Vocabulary builders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;Internet :&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Our technology has made one of the wonders is internet. People make miracles using internet. Communication is going easy day by day. Its a learning tool. One can introduce oneself to the world. There is no end to the people who want to gain knowledge. It is very hard to digest that it not only provides good, but also bad. Generations are depending more on internet, always bad cathes eye faster than good. Parents are more worried about their children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
