<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;5/24/2018 10:56:22 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the move to demonetize old 500 &amp;amp; 1000 rupees notes a good one? Suggest measures to be taken by the government to fine-tune the digital payment/cashless economy.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On night of November 8 2017 India received one its&amp;nbsp; biggest blow with economic reforms that is "The Demonatisation" which sent shocks across the nation.Demonatisation was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was accompanied by Finanace minster Arun Jaitely and President Shri Pranad Mukerji.It meant that 1000 and 500 rupee notes which existed on or before Nov 8 2017 were invalid from the following day.It was first proposed in the year 2000 after a series of discussions it came into effect in the year 2017.The Prime Minister employed a team named as "Black room"&amp;nbsp; which would come up several stragies to make this demonatisation a success and solve the issues related to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The newly printed 2000 and 500 rupee notes had distinguished features such as sensors installed in them,which would hep detect the accumulated money for a long time at the single place and there was a color change also.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; The reform also stated that all the old 1000 &amp;amp; 500 were to be deposited in the banks on or before 31 December 2017. And the people who deposited greater than there income llevels&amp;nbsp; were answerable to the government on account of holding excess amount of money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The advantages of the reform are as&amp;nbsp; follows:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1)One of the reason for introducing demonatisation was to prevent corruption a report by a distinguished Journal said that 80% of the public servants were corrupt and this movement was a check on such people as they were answerable on every extra penny in there pockets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;2)It was also introduced with the motive to curb terrorism as it involved loads of money which was used for various activites like for purcahasing the weapons,for transport war material etc., was obtained through Illegal activities as well as printing the fake currency this move will eradicate bot of the at a single shot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3)Money Laundering was one of the major problems back then the but with the advent of&amp;nbsp; demonatisation this is&amp;nbsp; problem on the road to get&amp;nbsp; streamlined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;4)With the cash crunch in the country it helped the nation adapt to online ways of using the money such as use credit cards,debit cards and cash wallets like Paytm,Paypal etc.,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;which was in-terms of the View of our Prime Minister to&amp;nbsp; make India Cashless and paperless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;5)Even in Rural Idia Online payments were being made paving a way for digital India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Disadvantages of Demonatisation are as follows:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1)As nation is Agriculture driven the farmers faced with the problem of unavailability of cash to purchase the seeds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2)The real estate sector came to a stand still as there were no propestive buyers to the finished or under construction houses due to the cash shortage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3)As people had to stand in long queues to deposit the money as well as to collect it there were many deaths on account of it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;4)At many Atms there were no cash boards or long line of people standing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;4)The Rural banks were not supplied with the Sufficient new currency notes which Aggravated the problems of small and medium scale enterprises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;5)The Economic critics worldwide viewed&amp;nbsp; that the cash was easier to save in the form new 2000 notes when compared to the 100 or 500 rupee notes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;6)One of the critical disadvantages was there was`nt sufficient change available for Rs.2000 as the new 500 rs notes were not in circulation by then.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Demonatisation is a two edged sword wherein its has its advantages on par with disadvantages.The movement was`nt timed properly as a reason it gained rejection across the nation.And the government was sometimes&amp;nbsp; deaf ear to the cash crunches and adverse effects related to it.The main motive of this move was to expose the Illegal people in that pursuit the common man was burdended.Neverthless the pain faced the common man was always supportive towards the movement as he belived that it would help the nation to become a better one.All credit the Prime Minister and his team for coming with such reforms and New Intitiatives like GST(Goods and Service Tax) and keeping our hope alive that India will one day become a Developed Country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In The Era of revolution the Smart grid Vendor Landscape is also on the road to change its course.In the wave of change the markets in the developed countries like North America,Europe and East Asia are maturing and consolidation of vendors is also taking place.To Improve the co-ordination between the Smart metering,distribution automation and home energy management several vendors are offering integrated solution throughout the smart metering value chain and on the other hand communications and data analytics providers are active across multiple smart grid segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;With the expectation of high growth rates the markets in the emerging countries like Latin America, Africa etc., are begining to grow.The study depicts the trends involved in shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how the firms are paving their path to success.This study deals with the vendors accounting to 500 who are active participants of various smart grid projects across the world and has also been helpful in assessing as to which collaboration would be fruitful.This study also&amp;nbsp; shows that there is a cut throat competition between the vendors in the growing market and states that Smart grid investment will reach $380 by 2025 across 125 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;Brazil and its journey to become the Smart Grid Market Leader:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Brazil stands at the fifth position in terms of population in the world and it is one of the emerging markets in terms of smart grid development.The development is backed up by the&amp;nbsp; Government support and efficient market conditions which are levelling the road and are helping it become the market leader.Efficient management of non-technical distribution losses will have an immediate effect on the revenue.As the country moves ahead the realiability and energy savings will become prominent.By 2021 it is set a target of replacing 63 million existing electrochemical meters with smart meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In year 2012 the government introduce a "opt-in" a regulation norm, for all the existing customers and it implies to the new customers too,has`nt been viewed as a catalyst for those expecting a mandate replacement of existing 63 million legacy meters with smart ones.In this regard Northeast group has anticipated that this regulation norm will be a road block in achieving the estimated target while the government officials and regulators are optimistic about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Road ahead for Brazil is being made easy with the strong support of its political and economic conditions but the question was how fast are those deployments going to take place.But it is viewed that by the end of the decade majority of the Brazilian homes will be smart meters installed as the teams are working earnestly to install the new meters and also reduce the non-technical losses.Neverthless the activities done to reach the target of 63 million smart meter the "Opt-In" regulation hampered the path.However Brazil still stands as a efficient smart grid market both for the vendors and the customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms. With high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors and smaller, more fragmented local players will help shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. This study takes a comprehensive look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positioning themselves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across all regions of the world, highlights growing regions and market segments, and assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions that are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries, smart grid investment will reach $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. This study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of the hundreds of vendors competing for this growing market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market &amp;ndash; An Insight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development. With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action. Like many emerging market countries, Brazil has high rates of non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also has a rapidly growing economy, which is beginning to strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it&amp;nbsp; set a non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However,&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; August&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2012, the&amp;nbsp; government&amp;nbsp; announced&amp;nbsp; an&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;opt--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;in&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meter&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; regulation&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; customers,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Paired with&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; requiring&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; new&amp;nbsp; customers.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp; was&amp;nbsp; not&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; anticipated&amp;nbsp; market&amp;nbsp; catalyst&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; those&amp;nbsp; expecting&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; binding&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; replace&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million existing legacy&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; result,&amp;nbsp; Northeast&amp;nbsp; Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its initial 63 million smart meter target. Yet, some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be achieved, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;With strong underlying economic and political conditions, it is inevitable that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade. The question is simply how fast deployments will take place. Through a combination of new meter installations, smart meters targeted at reducing non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt; technical losses, and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications, more than half of Brazilian homes will have smart meters by the end of the decade. However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
