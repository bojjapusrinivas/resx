<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/27/2015 5:09:55 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;As mentioned in the above topic i believe our dependence on computers has increased tremendously, right from kg to PG we are dependent on computers. In todays generation computers are very usefull to us. Even a small information is available on computers. Even the school going childern are also dependent on vedio listining rather than audio listening. In most of the organiasations works are related to computers.A common man to survive in todays generation he should have a basic knowledge of computer. Through google we can get any information sitting at home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Computers are also useful to many college going students like for there project purpose.Through computer we can learn any sitting at home.Sitting for a long time in front of computer improves our typing speed at the same time it may cause an effect to our eyes.In hyderabad there are many data based companies,so a person having a knowledge about the company and good education can easily step in to the job.Even in colleges and schools many lecturers are dependent on ppts rather than hand work,which also helps the students to listen interestingly which is possible through computers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;AS discussed above computers is usefull for many purpose , if we discuss above computers there are lot many things to say where we don`t find an end. My opinion about computers is how much education is important to a humanbeing computer is also that much important. See a human-being with good education and without computer knowledge can`t secure a job easily.So in order to survive in the present generation along with education computer knowledge is also usefull, then only it makes a complete person.Even for booking movie tickets and for many things computers are usefull.I believe computers are very helpfull to make our life faster and better.Compared to past generation to present generation we can find a drastic change in the tecnology.For example we use to have a normal phones , but now we can see a smart phone with every one. Even a daily wage earner has a smart phone.Along with the changing generation we can find a change in technology.So we has to get adaptable to this changing generation and technology.I believe computers are very important in this generation.If we use it in a proper way it will help us to reach our destination or else it is harmful.Like there is a talk many teenagers and youngsters get spoiled through changing tecnology.As educated persons we know what is good and what is bad,our success depends upon us,we can't simply blame the technology.I think it is good to get adaptable to the changing technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013GlobalAutoIndustryOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in the above passage it talks about Global Auto &amp;nbsp;Industry Outlook.The industry is highly concentrated,top 10 global automakers account for 80% but nearly 90% of total vechiles sold in the U.S.In the first five monthsof 2013, we can find general motors company led with 18.0%, followed by ford motor companywith 16.4% as marketshare.And toyota motors crop with a14.2% market share,chrysler-fiat with a 11.7% market share, honda motor co and nissan motor co at the last spot with 9.5% and 8.1% market shares.If we compare it we can see a fall in the market share.Toyota recaptured general motors by selling 9.75 million vechiclesin 2012,which exeedes gm's sales of 9.29 million vechiles.Germany's volkswagen ag came third with sales of 9.07 million of the year.&lt;br /&gt;OPPORTUNITIE: In order to remain competitive, the automakers need to desing vechiles so that they can cater to consumers in both mature and emerging markets while manufacturing them at low cost using the advanced technology.&lt;br /&gt;They have taken the example , ford as undertaken ''One Manufacturing'' strategr,which aims at producing multiple models from plants across the world but the automakers anticipates producing 4.5 models at each of its plants by 2015, up from 3.6 models.&lt;br /&gt;Futher the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features rather than small and less gas-guzzle rvechiles to attract buyers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The automakers continue to shift their production favilities from highb cost regions to low cost regios. All together it represented more than 50% of growth in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 &amp;ndash; Global Auto Industry Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In the first five months of 2013, General Motors Company ( GM ) led with a 18.0% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. ( F ) with a 16.4% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. ( TM ) with a 14.2% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 11.7% market share, and Honda Motor Co. ( HMC ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( NSANY ) at the last spots with 9.5% and 8.1% market shares, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;OPPORTUNITIES &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;To remain competitive, the automakers will need to design vehicles that will cater to consumers in both mature and emerging markets while manufacturing them at low-cost using the most advanced technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;For example, Ford has undertaken "One Manufacturing" strategy, which aims at producing multiple models from plants across the world in order to save production costs and fast adaptation to changes in consumer tastes. The automaker anticipates producing 4.5 models at each of its plants by 2015, up from 3.6 models currently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Further, the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features (which will save money on gas), even on the small and less gas-guzzler vehicles in order to attract buyers. The sale of optional features is helping them offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to large trucks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The automakers continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. According to a study by CSM Worldwide, China and South America together will represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The role of governments is highly significant. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years. In late 2011, 13 major automakers, including Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Volvo, have signed letters of commitment with the U.S. Government to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
