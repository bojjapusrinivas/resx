What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Health care plays an important role in India&amp;nbsp;in the following ways:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government of India should provide a enough land to to build the hospitals because now a days people are much&amp;nbsp;health consicous and also provide area, state and country wise awarness to people about health care products. Hospitals should have various health products relating to many issues like cancer,diabities,coma,ortho,ent,skin etc.These hospitals who give awarness not only to their patients about also for other people who can try and use&amp;nbsp;their products and improving&amp;nbsp;people&amp;#39;s health.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Hospitals are to be faclititated with spacing between each sections so that crowdness is avoided.There is a gap between&amp;nbsp;demand and supply of healthcare prodcuts so government make these products by using less chemicals and drugs which are unsafe&amp;nbsp;to people&amp;#39;s health.Demand for these products are more and supply is less,so the hospitals need to advertise their chemical and drug free products. This is done with who are&amp;nbsp;having expertise in this field with use of information technology and commuicate these processes to members dealing with such process within the hosiptal.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Once&amp;nbsp;this done, there now many hospitals coming up and there will be competition in the economy&amp;nbsp;which increases the flows of these products by using eco friendly materials which are available in cost effective fashion.These products will not only be available to urban city patients but also to rural and very lower areas&amp;nbsp;patients like the farmers etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Thus, a government having a legal rules and restrications on chemical and drugs will be successful in implementing the chemical and drugs free which&amp;nbsp;can be&amp;nbsp;recyclyed and reused i.e., by going green and pollution free products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
