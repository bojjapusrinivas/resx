What do you think are the major steps that can be taken in present circumstances to push growth in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes, Indian Economy can expect revival despite rising inflation because their are many talented and educated people in our country the only thing is those talents are not utilizing in the best way to achieve the economic goals of our country. Every individual who is living in this country should not only think about themselves but also for the welfare of our country then only we can expect good economic conditions in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;As we know that India is a developing country, so in such case it becomes necessary to&amp;nbsp;take initiative steps to have a control on inflation.
