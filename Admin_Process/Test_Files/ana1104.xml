Over the period 2012-2013, the average of vehicles in the US has increased from 11.3 years to 10.8 years. During this time the banks have also lowered the interest rates making loans cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;2012, auto sales in the US increased&amp;nbsp;by 13.4% (14.5 million) which is considered a record high in the five-year period. Further, as per Seasonally-Adjusted Rate (SAR), auto sales in the US increased to 10.9% (15.3 million) from 8.2% (1.44 million) in May, 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Economic Crisis in Europe&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Eurozone financial crisis affected the automakers throughout the world, especially the giants like GM and Ford who&amp;nbsp;have a significant market presence. This resulted in a drop in automobile sales in the Europe with consumers losing faith in the deteriorating economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, Europe recorded the lowest car sales in 2012 of 12.05 million over the past 18 years (European Automobile Manufacturers&amp;#39; Association, EAMA). The banks aggravated the situation by being reluctant to give fresh loans, due to their&amp;nbsp;looming non-performing assets. This resulted in a steep decliane in demand as evident from the year-on-year decrease in sales by 8.2%.&amp;nbsp;The Eurozone was worst affected with the car sales decreasing to a record low of 11.3% (9 million approx.) (Reuters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;The effect was also felt on the labor market as most of the major automakers resorted to cutting down their workforce to decrease the costs, as it was no longer profitable for them to operate at their full potential in Europe. Consequently, the unemployment rate increased to 10.9% (26.5 million) in March 2013 from 10.3% in March 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Moreover, automakers in US like FORD has decided to close down its manufacturing unit in UK and Belgium in next two years and General Motors plans to stop production at its plant in Bochum, Germany by 2016, making 3,100 workers unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in Europe automakers like Renault plans to cut-off its workforce in its plant in France by 7.500 by 2016, while Fiat and Peugeot also plan to retrench 1,500 workers.&amp;nbsp;The picture in almost similar in Japan where Honda has decided to remove 800 jobs in its plant at South Marston, Southwest England by the second quarter of 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don&amp;#39;t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;June 2013 - Auto Industry Outlook for the US and Europe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;U.S. Market Recovery &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;Strong pent-up demand due to aging vehicles on the U.S. roads along with falling unemployment rate have been the key factors in driving the auto sales in the U.S. Average age of vehicles on U.S. roads increased to 11.3 years in January 2013 from 10.8 years in 2012. Banks were also friendlier as they offered greater access to loans with lower interest rates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;Auto sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% to the five-year high of 14.5 million vehicles in 2012. In May 2013, auto sales in the U.S. grew 8.2% to 1.44 million units while it rose 10.9% to 15.3 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted rate (SAAR) basis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;Economic Crisis in Europe &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;The present Eurozone financial crisis has adversely affected the operations of many global automakers, especially GM and Ford, who have a significant exposure to the market. Car sales in Europe continued to be low owing to weak consumer confidence on the back of a weak economy triggered by the crisis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;According to the European Automobile Manufacturers&amp;#39; Association (ACEA), car sales in Europe reached its lowest level of 12.05 million units in 2012 since 1995, indicating a year-over-year decline of 8.2% due to the sagging demand for cars, as highly indebted banks were reluctant to finance new car purchases for customers. The decline was the steepest in the highly troubled Eurozone, where car sales dipped 11.3% to roughly 9 million units, according to Reuters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;Most of the major automakers in Europe are resorting to job cuts and plant closures, as it became no longer feasible for them to undertake full-fledged operations in the continent. Unemployment in the EU reached 26.5 million in Mar 2013, while the unemployment rate increased to 10.9% in the same month from 10.3% in Mar 2012. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;Among the U.S. automakers, Ford plans to shut vehicle and component plants in the U.K. and Belgium in the next two years while General Motors would suspend car production at its Bochum plant in Germany -- which employs 3,100 workers -- in 2016. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;Among the European automakers, Renault plans to retrench 7,500 jobs in France by 2016 while each of Fiat and Peugeot has decided to eliminate 1,500 jobs. Among the Japanese automakers, Honda announced plans to terminate 800 jobs at its South Marston plant near Swindon, southwest England in the second quarter of 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: `Times New Roman`, serif; line-height: 115%"&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
