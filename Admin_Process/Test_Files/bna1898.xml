<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/24/2015 5:09:51 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Computer is an electronic device that can store huge amounts of data and can perform arthematic operations in seconds and is no match to human performance.computers have become part of human life and there is no argument in it.computers have become essential in any organisation be it school or railways or airways, the fact that all these organisations need huge access to data and that has to be stored and used &amp;nbsp;remotely.computers in this generation has many user friendly features like ms office, outlook that makes the users feel comfortable working with and aviod the old traditional ways of doing things&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pros: knowledge of computers has become an essential qualification for any job because the companies are looking to save time and cost for performing the operations.Dependence on computers will &amp;nbsp;actually develop the individuals becuase people are inculcated with latest knowledge that is required for this generation and people show more interest to perform as it provides many exciting careers across the globe. technology plays a crucial role in deciding the dependence because advanced technology makes life easier and who does not want to make life easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cons: too much dependence on computers may actually prove costly for the organisations as they are required to train the individuals in the usage of computers and the fact that human knowlede is being wasted by using computers , this has to stop for the betterment of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;conclusion: dependence on computers is something people have been habituated to, but the development of individuals depends on the factors and &amp;nbsp;need for the use of computers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:SouthKorea2013EconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;South korea`s economy has been on the rise as the gdp fgrowth indicates &amp;nbsp;a strong showing and expansion for industry and consumer spending. While the investments are dependent on the global trade cycle, exports may not be recoverd given declinig growth rates in china.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has seen a never before rise due to strengthining of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production turned positive after two years of contradicting result and manufacturing activity has grown at the fastest pace in more than two years with domestic orders playing a huge driving force than &amp;nbsp;foreign.Growing consumer sentiment is an example of domestic orders setting up the rise in manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from the twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy to support the economy because of which south korean parliment ratified &amp;amp;4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and medium enterprises and boost corporate and real estate sector through tax incentives.The government expects these measures to pusg gdp growth given that fiscal defecit is managable &amp;nbsp;and create 40000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOK`S move in easing the monetary policy by 25 basis points may help south korea`s export competitiveness increase which was not possible with out the ease in monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
