List out and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China &amp;ndash; Economic Outlook for 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fast can China grow? That is the question underlying much of the discussion about China&amp;rsquo;s economy these days. Clearly, double digit growth is not in the cards and may even be a thing of the past. Growth of 7.7 percent in the first quarter was considered disappointing, and, until recently, many analysts were expecting growth to revert to the range of 8&amp;ndash;9 percent. Yet now the government appears determined to reset expectations. The government has forecast that growth this year will be 7.5 percent, a good deal lower than many private analysts had forecast only recently. That is certainly slower than the 7.8 percent growth in 2012, which was the slowest rate of growth in 13 years. Premier Li Keqiang, in a recent speech in Germany, said that growth for the remainder of the decade will average an even lower 7.0 percent per year. Although far slower than the growth experienced during the past two decades, Li indicated that China is &amp;ldquo;entering a range of reasonable growth.&amp;rdquo; Given that China has become a more mature economy with a declining labor force, Li is probably correct in setting more modest expectations. Moreover, growth of 7.0 percent is not bad: It doubles the GDP in 10 years. Li said that a combination of industrialization, urbanization, improvements in agricultural productivity, and investments in technology can contribute to healthy growth, and that this requires more market-oriented reforms. He also said that &amp;ldquo;for a very big economy, this is not easy.&amp;rdquo; When and how such reforms will be implemented remains uncertain. While some reforms have been announced, many government statements have been relatively vague. With a new regime just installed, it could take some time to build the support necessary to implement much needed reforms. In the interim, China faces some risks, including the ramifications of large local government debt, considerable leverage in the shadow banking system, and weaker-than expected manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing weakness stems from weakness in export markets. In addition, rising wages in China are having an adverse impact on export competitiveness, thereby leading to an exodus of manufacturing capacity. Thus, even growth in the range of 7&amp;ndash;8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further global integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves China&amp;rsquo;s economic relationship with the rest of the world. China&amp;rsquo;s government now says it will study the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP), an effort to create a free-trade area in the Pacific Basin. Currently there are 12 countries involved in this effort: the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. If China joins the group, the TPP will collectively account for more than half of global GDP. Freer trade would entail not simply lowering tariffs and quotas, although this would be an important component. It would also involve freeing up domestic markets so that they would have to compete freely with foreign companies. From China&amp;rsquo;s perspective, this could be a positive development in that it would create pressure to privatize state-run companies, create a level playing field for the private sector, and allow free movement of prices of goods and credit. Still, agreement on the TPP is probably a long way off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
