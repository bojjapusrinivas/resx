<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;12/27/2013 5:18:09 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this digital age, do you think modern inventions have made our lives simpler, or more complex and dangerous? Discuss with examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly believe that modern inventions have made our living very simpler. Each and everyone are aware of the technologies what they are using. For example &amp;quot;inverters&amp;quot;. We&amp;nbsp;find inverters not only in urban areas but also we find in the rural areas. Modern inventions are very useful in many sectors. Every organizations, business firms, industries etc., use new software that are making their databases more secured because security of the company&amp;#39;s information is very important and plays a pivotal role. The automobile industry has grown very fast due to its modern tools and techniques. Earlier the automobile industry was constant because of its same technology but due to the modern inventory it has reached beyond the expectation. For example automobile&amp;nbsp;companies like Toyota, Renault,&amp;nbsp;Mahindra and many have made a good and decent image in the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Coming to the telecom industry it has made a fast growth by its new innovations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3G technology made the telecom industry more reliable. Still the telecom industry is making effort for 4G &amp;amp; 5G. The present generation is much dependent on the telecom industries new inventions. I believe that telecom industry should improve more inventions keeping in view of the safety of the people in the environment because the radiations are very high due to which dangerous disease like cancer. So I feel that the telecom industry should take corrective measures in order to decrease the radiations which is very dangerous.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Technology is never ending it keeps on growing day by day. Agriculture is the major thing throughout the world. Earlier the farmers used to have problems in cultivation due to less technological efforts. But due to modern innovations in agricultural sector like huge machinery and good quality seeds has grown the productivity level rapidly. Now due to technology both the government and the people are enjoying their commodities like rice, wheat,&amp;nbsp;paddy etc.,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I also feel that due to modern inventions the present generation had become lazy. For example mobile handsets are providing&amp;nbsp; no. of apps which are not at all required and has no use for the individuals. But many are addicted to that because of which they are wasting the time and we all know that &amp;quot;Time is Money&amp;quot;. I believe that the mobile handset companies should take corrective measures and should deliver the required applications which is required for their future.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Finally I want to conclude that Modern&amp;nbsp;Inventions is both Boom as well as Bane. It is our obligation to know&amp;nbsp;that what we are using and how we are using the resources.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
