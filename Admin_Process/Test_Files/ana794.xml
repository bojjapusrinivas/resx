Once the mighty British empire which boast of &amp;#39;Where sun never sets&amp;#39; &amp;nbsp;collapsed due to war wearyness and increased patriatic zeal among indians,all the other colonial states realised the unavoidable reality of the modren world.In this circumstances our first prime minister Came up with an appraoach that is all new,all trustworthy to the third world countries,that is &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;alienism&amp;quot;. This theory set a dias for the emerging nations to bargain their rights on the international platforms like UN ,since then the countries like India Egypt Sweden etc.,are in good bilateral ties for promoting their business and get safe guarding their&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;economic interests,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the event of threat from the industrilized mighty nations like US Britain Germany etc.,.When coming to the current global crisis the recession caused due to under production due to low demand from markets. reasons behind low demand is &amp;nbsp; low salaries to the employees, and raising &amp;nbsp;inflation makeing their lives even more costlier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;The emerging nations are also suffering&amp;nbsp;due to consequences of the recession in this global economy where no country is enough &amp;nbsp;self reliant to get segregated &amp;nbsp;from the global economy, unavoidablly facing the problems because of this recession.The countries like india where the public sector plays prominent role unlike western counries,are now changing their polocies and &amp;nbsp;privitising the public sector undertakings, to get more investment for the exploitation of the resources.By privitization countries suffering with lack of adequate capital &amp;nbsp; can easily get the investment needed for the explotation of resouces and to create enough employement opertunities to the unemployeed youth of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indian govt as well as the countries in the ASEAN region realised the future of the global economy,and countries like Brazil, Chaina, South Africa are turning their attention from US to other parts of the globe to have free trade agreements and free economic zones with emerging nations to leverage their economic interests.&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;To better diplay this phenomenon take the example of Singapore which is now striving to portray India as best place to invest,so as to create a win-win situation to both singapore and india.&amp;nbsp;Undoubtdly by the turn of second quarter of this 21st century the wegiht of the globe changing to the East from West. Fortunatly all the emerging countries have good political structure with some exception like Pakistan and Iran so it will improve the prospects of booming economy in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the emerging countries now trying not to be just self-reliant,they turned their attention to export more and to import less so get a better picture of balance of payments sheet.this is welcoming phenomena. India is also doing in this regard but not at the pace of the other coutries,we should speed up our economy and to compell our youth to work more to not let any other country to let us behind,Govt should realize the ugly face of the subsidies they are providing &amp;nbsp;for vote-bank politics.Subsidies In no doubt &amp;nbsp;hampering the growth of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should also aware of their countrie&amp;#39;s economic matters as they are the writers of their destiny.people in any means should not encourage the freebies,they must know that freebies are always preventing bright future for their childern. For all the emerging nations corruption is the common problem with politicians &amp;nbsp;governing bodies and excutuive officers in the govt,which is also in certain measures hindering the growth of the economy,the statutory framework shoulnot allow any space to let the people corrupt. The people of all these countries should aware that all the developed nations in the world are goodand stringent &amp;nbsp;at their measures against corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;Emerging nations have in no doubt had &amp;nbsp;a great role in reviving global economy,these nations &amp;nbsp;are the destinations for the investment in the upcoming decades,but only when they had transparent governments ,political stability,educated youth who have burning blood in thier veins to take part in the succes story of the country. But the question is the governing bodies have capability to catch up with opertunities that are passing in front of them,In case of Indian Govt. LINIENCY the only thing that any one can expect from the Govt. it is a big challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
