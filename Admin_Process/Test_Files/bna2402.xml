&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India is the country which consists of various people and different religious who transport to different areas and there also many tourists places where would people from different counties come to visit. From my childhood I was hearing that India is a developing country and till now also it`s only in the stage of developing. I feel it would be better if the technology improves. So that our country may come into the stage of developed. Many measures were being taken by our prime minister about the developement of the country. The developements like making girls to study , providing women empowerment, making few places better than before,rennovating the piligrims in order to not to loose our monuments, make in India concept, demonitaization of notes etc., India is a country where there are no. of opportunities to be given to the people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;The above developments may chnge the country to the developed stage from the developing stage.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and formost let us know what are the conditions of our trains. Trains in our country are over crowded, delayed, no proper tracks like break between the tracks which causes accidents, the electricity is not proper during the rainy season etc., in this way there are many problems in the Indian railway system.Few places in India even doesn`t have the train facilities.We can solve this problems by providing better train services.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let us know what are the better trains and the bullet trains. The better trains are like improving the current facilities of the trains or solving the existing problems (mentioned in the above paragraph) of the railway system. The better trains are like we need to improve the services of the railways than that are before. The bullet trains are like the fastest trains. They provide the fastest services like maintaing the schedule as it is laid and making the passangers convinient and making them to reach their destination quickly. Actually the name bullet train itself shows that the train travels in a bullet speed i.e., it travels as fast as possible. this train provides the passanger with better transportation like reaching the destination faster than the normal trains like passanger, express or superfast express.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel first we need to improve our railway system by resolving the existing problems through improving the services of railways and then introduce the bullet trains. Because introducing bullet trains without providing better sevices is waste. As there won`t be any change in the railway system even after introducing bullet trains if the sertvices of the Indian railways doesn`t change.As there are many problems in the services of the system we need to change the existing problems first and then think of introducing the new projects.By improving the services i.e., through the better trains &amp;nbsp;India can be little developed in the terms of better transportation services.By providing bullet trains transportation services to the people are improved so that the the people can attend their work on time and the work can be done properly which inturn gives the benifits to the people by improving the wealth of them and which simultaniously improves the wealth of the economy and which leads to development in India. I feel there is an interlink with every decision taken by the government to the developement of the country. As people from different places come to India to visit the tourist places it would be effective if we provide good transportation services.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Through above thoughts I can conclude my views by saying that the introduction of bullet trains must be made but only after there is a development in the services of railway system in India. Without change in the provider of the service there won`t be any change in implementing new service as there won`t be proper functiong of new services. Providing bullet trains would improve the transportation services of the country.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;"BETTER SERVICES , BETTER INDIA"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
