Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is possible to ensure balanced regional development under Indian parliamentary democracy. In democracy every one has a right to express his/her thoughts and problems.&amp;nbsp;The government of India has appointed Raghu ram Rajan committee to rate the development of the state under 10 rate weighted scale. By this the Government of&amp;nbsp; India&amp;nbsp;gets the clear image of&amp;nbsp;the status of the regions. Based on that the Government of India can take necessary steps&amp;nbsp; for the balanced development of the regions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The concerned member of the parliament&amp;nbsp; and the&amp;nbsp;central minister&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; that &amp;nbsp;particular region has to address the issues and the backwardness of the region in the parliament .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; In Andhra Pradesh, telangana region is less developed . As the major resources are available in the particular region but the it has been not beneficial for the people of telangana.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Eg: Nizam sugar factory in Medak (dist) , a decade ago it was a public ltd company.&amp;nbsp; A few years back it&amp;nbsp;has been privatized and now it has been closed. In this particular district maximum percentage of the people&amp;nbsp; depends on the agriculture ,this district is suitable for the cultivation of sugar cane. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; By this people has lost their jobs and farmers&amp;nbsp; didn&amp;#39;t find alternative solution , most of them&amp;nbsp; stopped&amp;nbsp; cultivation of the crop and moved to the urban areas for the work(employment).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The issue&amp;nbsp; of backward ness of telangana has been raised&amp;nbsp; in the parliament of India. It has been discussed thoroughly in the parliament&amp;nbsp;,for the development of the particular region&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;government of India&amp;nbsp;has bifracuvated the&amp;nbsp; Andhra Pradesh.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; After bifracuation of Andhra Pradesh ,for&amp;nbsp; the development of Andhra Pradesh&amp;nbsp; the government of India has been giving the special package for Seem Andhra development.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;By this both the regions will be developed equally and simultaneously.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Eg 2:Gurkaland in West Bengal.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In West Bengal Gurka land is less developed, when compare to other parts of the Bengal. The&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; member of parliament of the&amp;nbsp; West Bengal has raised the issue about the backwardness of the Gurka land in Bengal. The MP&amp;#39;s has agreed about the&amp;nbsp; backwardness of the particular region, some of them have demanded for the&amp;nbsp; separate state and others demanded for the special package.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government of India is working on this issue for giving a special package for the development of&amp;nbsp;particular region.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;By this in my view I ensure that balanced regional development is possible through the Indian Parliamentary&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
