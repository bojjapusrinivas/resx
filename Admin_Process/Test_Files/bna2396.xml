&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Bullet trains are those which runs with electricity. There is no involvement of human for operations. These trains are very fast. The operating system is already fixed. It works automatically. Where as in normal trains there is a involvement of human. The cost involvement is also to high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In India there is no bullet trains. Foreign countries are operating bullet trains because they are developed countries in technology. The population in India is around 125 croes, it is better if Indian government moves from normal trains to bullet train. The traffic is very heavy in India,people are facing so many problems by traffic. We can reduce traffic by introducing bullet trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Pollution also we can reduce (noise, air pollution) by introducing bullet trains in India. Though the infrastructure of our country is very poor. But the government should take initiative to introduce this in some metropoilitine cities like Delhi, Bengulur and Mumbai i.e, where the population is very huge. But stil in India we are following traditional systems. People are not that educated. If the government introduce bullet trains in India the employment opportunities got reduced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; By introducing bullet trains the number of accidents happening daily also get decreased. And also huge number of people can travel so we can interact with different people. We can share knowledge. From our childhood onwards we are saying that India is a developing country. Everyone are interested that we should say India also a developed country. For that we should encourage and we should welcome the advanced technology. Indian govenrment should take necessary steps to introduce bullet trains so that we can see the developed economy. Automatically peoples living sytle will change. People became educate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;So it would be good if government introduce bullet trains in some locations where the geography permits. And specially in some locations in India still we don`t have &amp;nbsp;normal trains. In those locations normal trains are good. In some cities bullet trains are better. Government has started MMTS in all metro cities. It is good change and people are also support. Now adays people mind set has changed they are allowing new things and they are following new trends. Every one wants new system in economy so it would be better to introduce bullet trains in India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
