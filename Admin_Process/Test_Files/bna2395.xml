&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The topic is about Does India needs Bullet Trains Or Better Trains.According to me India is the second largest country to have more trains and the passengers to travel.Passengers who want to travel a long distances mostly prefer train journey because it is safest transport compare to all other transportations. As India is the most busy country where we can see many people passes through the trains and other transportations.Mumbai is the first state to have a bullet train in india which is a underground train through which many passengers travel through, and were the the Platforms will be filled with the passengers all the time. Due to this many accidents took place by people who rushes to the trains when they arrive at the platform. Presently India is having a better trains which are contraolled by the railway department of government of india,allowances provided to travellers are much better than comparing to the other transportations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Recently in china they introduced a bullet train which is fastest train in all over the world which is good to that country as they are having a high privilaged and secured railway tracks and all works automattically without the intervention of human being. But in India the Railway Tracks are in a ruining stage were they are causing a many train accidents in inida. Recently an Incident occured were many passengers severly injured and osme of them dead. So firstly Indian governement has to concentrate much on improving the railway tracks to readuce the train accidents. India is the country which is having many trains to travel from one place to another place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;According to my perception for every 10 persons 2 persons wills travel through train. were they are the best available source to every man. But in some situations they may be delay in arrival of train due to that many passengers can face problems,it may be because of damaged railway tracks or busy railway netwroks.Recently the govt of india have done many improvements in allowing good environments in local trains and also providing a women helpline numbers as well as a seperate desk to travel for them by that they can have a safe jouney. This is the best part of Indian Trains. Now in india the Goverenment also introduced a Metro Rails were the passengers can travel through out the city without any traffic problems, due to this the traffic problem can be solved easily. I think India is &amp;nbsp;Having a good trains but some changes must take place to become a better train facility to the passengers, they are of many issues like improving the railway tracks, automated staff, technology advancement in improving the facilities in train and also having a neat and clean environment in trains by which many passengers feel irritate in the express and passenger trains. Presently we need a Better trains rather than having a Bullet trains so as to reduce train accidents in india.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In coming Era we can also expect a Bullet trains in india which will be totally automated and also having a many technological advancements in improvemts of indian trains. As India is a Developing country we are expecting more to improve and also we are seeing the rapid changes in every field. One day India is also known as a safest country to travel in trains and also having a high speed Bullet train than other countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
