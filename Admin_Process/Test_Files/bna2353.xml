What would be the long term impact of this step on terror financing and creation of unaccounted wealth?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INDIA on November 8th, 2016 on the wee hours of TUESDAY evening!!!!!!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unpredicted accouncement in INDIAN history where MONEY value of currency notes of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 is lost along with its status of legal tender. &amp;nbsp; The whole Country and even the World did not breathe for a while. &amp;nbsp;Surely it is a big challenge for the whole country to understand and implement the demonetization effectively since it will have an adverse effect on the Indian GDP and the world`s eyes were on INDIA in this front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, any problem or challenges comes automatically with a solution either immediately or at a slow paced manner. &amp;nbsp;Our Government has also taken up this challenge along with surgical strike to unearth the black money and account for the welfare of the citizens and the Country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hats off to Shri. Narendra Modiji, the Honourable Prime Minister of India, a dynamic leader, who is the primary key in taking this decision with tremendous support from his ruling Government to unearth the BLACK money to fight against the terror financing, larger fake notes circulation, to account unaccounted wealth, to bringin cashless economy which in turn make INDIA grow to heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To brief, our India`s 70-80% of the money circulation is emerging with the middel class citizens in lower denominations. &amp;nbsp;But 20-30% of the money is revolved around the high end citizens with higher denominations which mainly determines the growth of the Country. &amp;nbsp;So the main target of the demonetisation is to unearth the 20-30% of the high end value circulation of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now been a fortnight post demonetisation, India has collected in banks around 1.55 lakh crore, which is an unimaginable funds to compare.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PROS and CONS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &amp;nbsp;HIGH-VALUE terror financing is living in INDIA with the help of cash market where the cash is converted in to terror weapons and terror humans, which is termed to be illegal and cause for concern. &amp;nbsp;The terror trafficking has ulmost come to stand still, &amp;nbsp;since the market has become cashless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &amp;nbsp;Ulmost majority of the black money is getting unearthed by way of deposits where the unaccounted money is now accounted. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &amp;nbsp;Since the tight secrecy is maintained at high end Government until the accouncement, the scope for pre conversions of black money in to white was evaded in a large manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &amp;nbsp;The population of India is so huge with 125 crores, the implementation of demonetisation is surely a big challenge which comes with its pros and cons. &amp;nbsp;But the Government has not gone berserk and levied steps to implement the same by adopting the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1. &amp;nbsp;All Banks (except Co-operative banks where most of the banks are run by the influence of politicians and they may influence the misue of the authority)and Post offices are the source to exchange the notes by producing the valid ID cards, which has put lot of pressure on the banks and the citizens to queue up for a long time to exchange the notes. &amp;nbsp;But it is inevitable to unearthen the black money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2. &amp;nbsp;ATM`s were put to shut initially since the caliberation for new Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 500 notes were not loaded. &amp;nbsp;In addition to this, smaller currencies of Rs. 100`s were also not available wherein our 60-70% of the population live thier lives with this currency. &amp;nbsp;This has termendously affected the purchase power of the population thereby affecting the various businesses right from pin to pen. &amp;nbsp;Daily wage workers and middle class have their tough times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3. &amp;nbsp;Government`s acceptance of fees, all categories of taxes, utility bills, emergency like hospital bills, basic facility like milk bills in old notes have helped the AAM Aadmi to have a little bit of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 4. &amp;nbsp;Lack of timely instructions to banks on separate queue for senior citizens, women, physically challenged people have created inconvenience and claimed few casualties too, which is implemented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at later stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 5. &amp;nbsp;Deposits made unlimited in banks/PO`s has given a scope to the people to deposit in large scale but the Taxmen has the right to question the heavy flow of funds while comparing to the last year`s IT returns. &amp;nbsp;The limit set of Rs.2.50 lacs which is unquestionable has lead the people to misuse the inoperative or less operative like PM yogana accounts to rent their accounts and help the black money holders to conver into white. &amp;nbsp;The Government has levied the the Binami Act effective from 1st November, 2016 and stated that rented accounts will attract improsonment of 1-7 years with penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 6. &amp;nbsp;The frequent changes in withdrawing capacity from banks/ATM`s has left the public in confusion and losing the vision of next day`s operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 7. &amp;nbsp;According to the sources, where technocrats and CA`s are involved, the major reason for generation of black money is through evasion of tax. &amp;nbsp;If the Government brings in cashless economy, then the BTT (Bank transaction tax) can be levied with 2% alone as tax, wherein the tax evaders will become ulmost nil and the Government gets huge tax for the growth and the development of the Country in terms of decresing the poverty line, increasing earning per person capacity of the citizens, lead a comfortable life with good roads, buildings, basic facilities like hygiene home, food and clothes are provided to all the citizens, employment and new business opportunities will be tremendously increased with the huge funds availability and the funds will be made multi fold by the way of revenue generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 8. &amp;nbsp;The Government should also demonetise other lower denominations also to make India, a white money country thereby accounting for all unaccounted wealth by way of taxes, duties and all the citizens will also be obtaining the satisfaction of paying taxes and be at peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 9. &amp;nbsp;Avaibility of updated information on periodicals, leading newspapers, online informations has helped a lot to update the information to the public to avoid inconvenience and plan for their day-to-day activites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMART ELEVATOR MARKET- A major revenue generator by 2020 due to new deployment anticipated in Asian counties especially major contribution by China, accounting 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase in the urban population residing in cities from 34 percent to 54 percent of the total world population during the period 1960-2014 and the estimation of increase in urbal population growth at the rate of 1.80 percent has resulted in vertical growth to accomodate the urban population. &amp;nbsp;This increase has paved the way to rise in number of high-rise buildings demanding a standardised, comfortable, efficient, secure vertical transportation system i.e. Smart elevators adhering to the worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the requirement of high-rise buildings, modernization of conventional elevator systems is mandatory to meet the requirement for the advanced technology featuring integration of intelligent communication, access control, security technology in all segments such as domestic and industrial sectors including residential, commercial, healthcare, hospitality etc. &amp;nbsp;These domestic and industrial sectors demands smart elevators with credibility, comfortability, spacious, controlled security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many global vendors, to name a few, ThyssenKrupp holding the major share of&amp;nbsp;1.1 million elevators has now adopted cloud capabilities to its systems in order to improve their maintenance services related to gathering valuable data about systems and sensors. &amp;nbsp;In the same way, Schindler Elevator Corporation have modernised their elevators through installation of PORT elevator technology and dispatch technology system and installed successfully at the Union Plaza Office buildijng, Puerto Rico, The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America om MAnhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMART elevator market growth in Commercial applications!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial applications includes offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes) which is entirely different from the requirement of the domestic applications demanding more carrying capacity, deeper elevator systems, vandal proof material, spacious and ride comfort elevators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparitively, the energy consumption in large commercial buildings is more due to inter-floor traffice of people. &amp;nbsp;In view of the above, the giant players in the market are in the process of investing their energy, time and resources to find innovating solutions to save power without compromising the&amp;nbsp;quality aspect and the&amp;nbsp;satisfaction of the customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 saving more power and reducing energy consumption up to 10%, which definately impacts in reduing the global warming effects. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
