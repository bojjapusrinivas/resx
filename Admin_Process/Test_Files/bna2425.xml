&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Now-a-days in india transportation has increased due to increase in population ,in india trnasportation is difficult due to heavy traffic jam mostly in metropolitan cities like Hyderabad Mumbai, Delhi, Bengalor etc in order to avoid this traffic jam from ancient years many innovations and developments came into existance and those has been modified by our Engineers all the time. Even though there is some lag in transportation facilities 1st bicycle has been introduced next vehicles (two &amp;nbsp;wheelers, three and four soon), all these are helpful for smaller distances, But not for longer distance .In order to make transportation easier trains and buses came into existance, these made transportation easier, faster and comfortable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;India needs Bullet train because in india the population has been increasing year by year for many different reasons like tourism, employment purpose education purpose to settle down in cities etc., As the population increases the locomotive(moment) also increases due to which transportations made so worried problem due to increase number of two wheelers three and four by introuducing trains i.e Bullet trains the transportation can be reduced to certain extent .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Recently the japnese has introduced a train in such a way that the transportation of other vehicles is not disturbed and there is a separate bridge like in which the other vehicles can go easily with out any waiting and there is another innovation is that &amp;nbsp;the tracks will be changed according to time set by the railway department people to different junctions at different time . In the similar way in india there is an neccessity of the Bullet trains .Bullet trains can be helpful in reaching the distination point faster and comfortably, In recent survey the in Delhi the metro trains has made the transportation of the public better comparied to the past one. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The more innovation makes more faster and comfort &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In western Countries Bullet trains made more comfortable to those people who wanted to travel farer distances. Compare to airways and ships Bullet train travelling is cheaper because the cost of airways is more and everyone cannot efford it similarly coming to ships the cost and time is more and in present days the world is keep on changing with many Innovations in all the sectors mainly IT sector. By this we can say such innovations also made the western countries into a top place in the world due this every activity like business activity, marketing activity etc made easier. For example if the company A needs to deliver there goods into some city X then by bus route or four wheeler cannot be made easier as it takes more time and cost of transportation so the best way to deliver the goods in time to the city X can be made esaier through Bullet trains , they are not only for business purpose but personal purpose like to visit the places and emergancy case where the dear once is hospitalized .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Wih the Innovation of this Bullet trains in india can keep family together i.e can maintain the relationship better even though they stay a part from each other. Now a days many employeed ones are working like machines in the organisations due to increased competition in the business world so they could not make time for there family members even in holidays because there mind set has changed in such a way that they can take rest atleast in holidays so the employeed ones are avoiding the transportation to there native places. In order to avoid all these drawbacks atleast to some extent they can maintain the traditional values i.e ralationships . Due to heavy journies i.e hours together the people who does hours together journey has been fallen sick it &amp;nbsp;was survey by the hospital management people . By the Introducing of this Bullet trains in india people can maintain there health by avoiding lot many hours in the journy and can move faster and quick to the required destination. In every organization the employees could maintain there puncuality due to heavy traffic jam in cities some times the business make get loss due to the employment present in time, this can also be avoided through the bullet train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The Business can be done so faster and quickly in span of time from one place to another in India. &amp;nbsp;The employment can also be provided to the young Engineers in india so that the GDP can also increase to some extent in india through this innovative Bullet train introduction with the introduction of this Bullet trains there are many advantages and can be made many changes in the India which can leads to growth and many can be benefited through this Bullet trains in different aspects or activities.Therefore introducing a Bullet train can change the lives of people in india and can gain more advantages and profit &amp;nbsp;in India &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
