<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;12/17/2012 3:41:21 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India&amp;#39;s economic matters, there is an excessive tendency towards the thinking rather than doing. Elaborate with examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Yes, it is true that in our country we really give more emphasis on the thinking part than putting more effort on implementing&amp;nbsp;that thinking into practice. We are a democratic state where everyone has a freedom to speak and put their ideas in front of others. But it seldom happens as there is a formal&amp;nbsp;code of conduct where only our elected representatives can&amp;nbsp;decide and implement those decisions. So&amp;nbsp;as a citizen of this country we can only&amp;nbsp;follow them. This means that these elected people can think on our part and&amp;nbsp;we have to trust them for this.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;But unfortunately these&amp;nbsp;representatives waste a lot of their time in thinking over these matters&amp;nbsp;rather than&amp;nbsp;doing it. It can be for many reasons like we have a very effective&amp;nbsp;press that is standing as the&amp;nbsp;trusted source of our information. Because the&amp;nbsp;media&amp;nbsp;acts as our mouth and asks the government of its policies and welfare programmes, the decision-makers have to prepare themselves as according to the needs of the common man.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So the government acts very carefully regarding the economic matters which really&amp;nbsp;affects our daily lives. Since we are a developing country,&amp;nbsp;economics is a matter of grave concern for all of us. Our all needs are based on the economy and&amp;nbsp;we all need money to survive as well. We are very much keen to become a super power one day but for that we have to be at par with the developed nations like the U.S, the U.K., the Phillipines etc..... where the decisions are being taken in the nick of time rather than wasting it in thinking.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Sadly the decision-makers are not much worried about the plight of the comman man and they do&amp;#39;nt understand that their delay in taking&amp;nbsp;a decision is going to affect all of us. Also the delay in taking a decision will impact the cost it will take and the burden will ultimately be&amp;nbsp;borne by the tax payers. These days the issue of F.D.I. is very much in the limelight as there is one section of the elected people who are for it and then there are&amp;nbsp;some&amp;nbsp;opposing it as well. It is&amp;nbsp;true that the implementation of F.D.I. will have its own pros and cons and so it might be beneficial for some people and also it can be an impediment for others. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We have the best of minds in various fields who can put us on the world map as the super power but sadly they are not a part of the decision making as ultimately it is only the people in power who can think, decide and implement. The biggest drawback is that there is not&amp;nbsp;a comman platform where the citizens can participate and act as the decision makers unlike the western countries where the citizens also raise their voice and concern to the state power. &amp;nbsp;It will be not possible at this stage but in the near future if this thing happens in our country than&amp;nbsp;it will be for the betterment of all of us. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We&amp;nbsp;are more prone to thinking&amp;nbsp;than acting but it is time that we should be&amp;nbsp;more active in terms of involving ourselves with the economic&amp;nbsp;policies and&amp;nbsp;decisions&amp;nbsp;as ultimately it&amp;nbsp;is going to affect us. Other than wasting their time in thinking the&amp;nbsp;decision-makers can involve themselves with&amp;nbsp;the other welfare programmes for the betterment of this country and its citizens.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The economic matters are very crucial which can impact us seriously and it has to be taken care of very carefully and yes the thinking part is also very important but rather than only thinking&amp;nbsp;and not doing is not a&amp;nbsp;correct way. So we as the responsible citizens of this country has this duty to perform to make this country&amp;nbsp;a better place to live as compared to other countries and also we have good platforms to raise this matter of grave concern like&amp;nbsp;media and&amp;nbsp;other forums where we&amp;nbsp;can raise our concerns.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
