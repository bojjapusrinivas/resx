Discuss three key factors for making `Make in India` a reality.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think `Make in India` can be practically possible if the people of india have the strong desire to achieve it. Basically,Make in India is all about manufacturing or producing the products in India itself using the land,labour,capital,material resources,man power,machinery etc.The products manufactured have to be sold either within the states of the country or else in foreign countries.But it is mandatory that the products manufacturing should be done in India only.That is why our Prime Minister Narendra Modi&amp;nbsp; has started a new initiative Program called `Make in India`to encourage the citizens of India to startup their own manufacturing hub to come up with innovative products or replica of products.Modi sir also have comeup with a mudra yojans and other schemes to startup their own business or manufacuring hub thereby giving assurance and confidence to the starters to setup their own manufacturing hubs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The program `Make in India` is very much beneficiary to the people of India in many ways.It would firstly contribute to the country`s economic development (as GDP) and enhance the country`s performance.Further as said that before all the innovative products have to be manufactured in India itself,there would`nt be any neccessity to import the same products from different countries.So there wouldn`t be any tax imposed for importing.Moreover, people who have started with this make in India can be the Sole proprietors of their Business,can be financially independent and can also gain a competitive advantage over others.These people should enure that they have patent rights,copy rights,trade mark and unique logo for their Indian manufactured product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The 3 key&amp;nbsp; factors for making `make in India` a reality would be the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1.Firstly,it is the strong desire and will power of the person that would lead him to be an entreprenuer to manufacture innovative or relpicated products only in India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;And moreover he should have that love and passion to contribute his/her part to thier Nation and should be compulsarily residing only in his country so that he /she can look after his business soley in regular intervals .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2.Secondly,they can make use of the mudra yogana schemes to&amp;nbsp; startup their business which could be used as the capital for their business.Most importantly the person should have the&amp;nbsp; guts and courage to face the risk involved in the Business and should stand firmly in case of difficulties and should learn to make strategies to minimize the risks and go on!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3.Lastly the person should sustain the business for longer duration and gain a competititve advantage over others.He should ensure that his product is marketed only within the states of the country but not foreign countries so that he can be saved from paying tax and in the other way he can ensure that the`MAKE IN INDIA`program is successful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the enhancement and development of technology,there is a rapid change in the Global smart grid vendor landscape.Specially in developed countries such as North America,Europe and East Asia the markets are maturing as well as the vendors are consolidating or shortening.Most of the larger vendors are now offering integrated solutions through the smart metering value chain.While the communications and data analytics providers are rapidly active across multiple smart grid segments thereby improving their coordination among smart metering,distribution automation and home energy management.Meanwhile the emerging countries such as middle East and North Africa,Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe,Eurasia,Latin America and South and Eastern Asia are just begining to grow.A huge crowd of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects on their own and also became a partners of large International firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;With high&amp;nbsp; growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries this would represent the next fronteir of international firms.The dynamics between growing and consolidating International smart grid vendors are samller.More and more fragmented local players will shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe.This study would take a comprehensive look at the trends which are shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positiong themselves to succeed.It includes all the 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across the regions of the world highliting the growing regions and market segments and assessing the existing partnerships ,mergers and acquistions that are alerting the smart grid market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; Brazilian Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is one of the leading emerging market countries interms of smart grid development.Brazil will now become one of the largest smart grid markets&amp;nbsp; in the world by the end of the decade as it has the fifth largest population with a government that is eager to modernize the country`s infrastructure.lLike may other emerging market countries ,Brazil also has high rates of non technical distribution losses,this would imply that utilities would reap immediate revenue protectiond benefits tharough smart meter deployments.With the increasing population growth of the country,there would be an inctrease in the reliability and energy saving benefits of smart grid.The Brazilian government&amp;nbsp;has taken a notice in 2009 to seta non-binding target of replacing all 63 million existing electromechanical meters with smart meters by 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However,in august 2012,the government announced a "opt-in" smart meter regulation for existing customers ,pairing with mandate requring smart meters for all new customers.But this wasn`t the anticipated market catalyst for those who are expecting binding mandate to replace all 63 million existing legacy metres target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the smart underlying economic and political conditins , it is envitible that Brazils smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming deacde.The question is simply how fast can the deployments wil take place.Through a combination of new meter installations , smart meteres have targeted to reduce non-technial losses and customers are eager to take the advantage od advanced smart grid applications .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half a brazilian hoimes have to meet smart meters by the end of the decade.However ,in August 2012, Regulations have fell short of the concrete and needed for brazil to meet it`s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021.Nonetheless,Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both the vendors and customers alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms. With high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors and smaller, more fragmented local players will help shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. This study takes a comprehensive look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positioning themselves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across all regions of the world, highlights growing regions and market segments, and assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions that are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries, smart grid investment will reach $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. This study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of the hundreds of vendors competing for this growing market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market &amp;ndash; An Insight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development. With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action. Like many emerging market countries, Brazil has high rates of non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also has a rapidly growing economy, which is beginning to strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it&amp;nbsp; set a non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However,&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; August&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2012, the&amp;nbsp; government&amp;nbsp; announced&amp;nbsp; an&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;opt--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;in&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meter&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; regulation&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; customers,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Paired with&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; requiring&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; new&amp;nbsp; customers.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp; was&amp;nbsp; not&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; anticipated&amp;nbsp; market&amp;nbsp; catalyst&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; those&amp;nbsp; expecting&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; binding&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; replace&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million existing legacy&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; result,&amp;nbsp; Northeast&amp;nbsp; Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its initial 63 million smart meter target. Yet, some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be achieved, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;With strong underlying economic and political conditions, it is inevitable that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade. The question is simply how fast deployments will take place. Through a combination of new meter installations, smart meters targeted at reducing non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt; technical losses, and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications, more than half of Brazilian homes will have smart meters by the end of the decade. However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
