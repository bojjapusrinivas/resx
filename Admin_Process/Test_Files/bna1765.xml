<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1/21/2015 10:29:35 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you agree with the concept of &amp;ldquo;make in India&amp;rdquo;? Can we have an efficient economy with better lifestyle for an average Indian citizen with this concept? Also elaborate if &amp;ldquo;make in India&amp;rdquo; could be a good initiation to achieve the set target for &amp;ldquo;made in India&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ofcouse its quite true that make in india could be a good initiation to achieve the target set for the development of the Indian economy.If we keep our focus to the core domestic sector in india then not only the indian economy will change but it will have a positive effect to the GDP growth in india.Currently in the year the gdp growth of india is 5.5 % which has been targeted to go rise by 7% to 8%.Basically what we are being served in the current scenerio is not but only the menu of crisis.Chinese slowdown,japan falldown and the almost all the top countries in the world is facing the problem of recession.Irrespective of these slow down the indian stock market is stable.The year 2015 is a turbulent year for all the developing and developed nations.After the election of 2015 most of the things have been changed this is why because the core domestic sectors have been targetted with positive response.Economy of the country develops only when the goverenment thinks about the more exports rather then imports.The core sectors in india like oil &amp;amp; gas,power,and infrastructure have a deep slowdown and nonchalant because they did not think logically on board basis.On the contrary the IT,automobile and pharmaceutical sectors are still in boom due to their logical thinking towards their economics and also because they didnot compared this year with 2014.It should be acknowledged that the India is doing well after the recession in 2008.The indian stock market is highly appretiated that it is keep growing and very stable.The GDP growth in india depends on the drivers such as the private sectors,Govt.exports and the on some other factors.Stock market donot think about the good or bad of the rich or middle class in india but its works only on the binary system i.e growth or no growth.The government has to keep lateral thinking towards the ossified problem prevails in the infrastructure sector india.By reviwing the current scenerio of the indian stock markets and the GDP growth in india it could be said that india is weak only in &amp;nbsp;ecological terms since the vastly populated density in the rural sectors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Indeed its natural phenomenon that if we move ahead with the concept of make in india then the indain economy will definitely rise.Most of the products that being used in india are imported from other countries.The rise in US dollar have made drastic change and defeated from the brazallian to indian currencies.Recently came in the news that FDI has taken an initiation steps to do the prolifiration of its bussiness.People aslo were aware of the facts that what could be happened if it starts its bussiness here.Nothing but the small scale industries in india would be highly affected.The core reason behind is that the procucts sold by the wallmarts are cheaper as compared to the other indian domestic manufacturers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Its is very important that we indian citizens should think about the products i.e made in india and should always be faithful to the concept of make in india because only making of indian products can keep growth to indian economy.I am completely agree with this concept and also have seen the impact in the recent and present year.Domestic products in india have to be given a positive response and the large and small scale industries should be given a positive jack from the government .This will not only help in the deveoplment of average indian citizen but also to the development of the nation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
