What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my views,India really there is an enormous gap between health care supply and demand. The demand for the requirement is more but there are no proper facilities in our country. Due to changing environment we are facing a lot of health problems. With the rapid changes in the climate is also a one of the reason for the rise of demand in our country.As well as due to impact of political environment too effects a lot for rising of demand for health care.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The chemicals which the farmers are using for cultivation is also effecting an individuals health.to every human being is more career focused rather than on caring about their health. Today with the changing&amp;nbsp;environment &amp;amp; increase in the competition have&amp;nbsp;led to create more reasons for health disorders.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The government need to tackle certain awareness programmes&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;improve the patient care.It must strive for improving the health condition of the peoples.It is not only the duty of government to&amp;nbsp;do all such things even the individuals are also responsible to take care about themselves.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Firstly&amp;nbsp;the government needs to make a survey on what&amp;nbsp;are the major reasons for the rise of health disorders &amp;amp; the it needs to find out the variation between the requirement &amp;amp;availability of facilities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Then it needs to&amp;nbsp;plan how to&amp;nbsp;fill such gap. Mere planning is not important ,it needs to implement those plans&amp;nbsp;in an appropriate&amp;nbsp;way. For all these it needs a talented people who can help them to bring up the improvement in healthcare system.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;According to my view, I can say that it can be improved through the following, it need to focus more &amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;increasing &amp;nbsp;the posts of doctors. There&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;a huge population in our country &amp;amp; there are many reasons for the doctors requirement, it need to focus on improving the quality as well the quantity of their availability for our country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;To fill the gap between the supply &amp;amp; demand for health care in India it has to make a scheme of providing facilities at reasonable. Reasonable doesn&amp;#39;t mean to fix the fee, it implies that basing on their standard of&amp;nbsp;living, earning power etc. Must be taken into consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I believe in the fact that &amp;quot;prevention is better than cure&amp;quot; so it is also a responsibility of an individual to take care about their health&amp;nbsp;before falling sick. Infact the success of government can be achieved when public cooperates with its work. With this I mean to say that individual work or effort could be beneficial for only their personal growth.In the same sense if we work&amp;nbsp;combined&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; cooperatively &amp;amp; with a coordination then it leads to growth of both individual as well as government.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly I conbclude by saying that unity gives&amp;nbsp;much strength to win the race.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
