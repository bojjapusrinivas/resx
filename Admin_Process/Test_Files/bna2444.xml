Firstly, there is no proper maintenance of the infrasture of the trains and the timing of the trains are also not maintained properly.And the reservation of seats are also not allotted properly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;I actually wanted &amp;nbsp;to share one of my experiance while travelling in train from delhi to hyderabad. When we were travelling, in the middle they made it as a local train and there were so many people who were boarding the train and there was so much of disturbance among the crowd and conflicts was arising among the people regarding the seats.And there was also no proper maintenance of washrooms were we have to stand in long ques. The food in trains was also not maintained properly. And there were some poeple with no train tickets.The ticket officer has also not done any justification regarding the reservation of the seats. Some people in train were not properly known where to get down and where to board. Therefore, these are some of the issues regarding the trains in India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;In order, to make trains better in India the government has to take certain steps regarding the betterment of the trains. The first thing, which has to be implemented is the display screens so that the people can know it better where to get down and where to board the train. For that the display of places or stop names must be done in three different languages i.e, English, Hindi and Telugu so that it reaches the common people better and the announcements of trains and platform number must also be done clearly, so that it wil be easy for the individuals to board the train. The second thing, is the reservation of the seats. The officers must allot the seats in such a way that there should be no disturbance regarding the allotment of seats.The seats should be alloted separately for Physical handicap, ladies and gents so that it won`t create any disturbance for the individuals. The third thing, is that the ticket officer must be fair enough while checking the tickets so that the individual without ticket has to be punishable or pay some amount of challan. The fourth thing, is the maintenance of food.The government has to take certain actions regarding the maintenance of the food.The fifth thing, is the timings of the train where the train timings have to be properly maintained and know to every individuals about when is the arrival time and depature time. And last it is regarding the maintenance of the washrooms. The washrooms must be kept clean in trains and they have maintain separately for ladies and gents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;So, lastly i conclude these are some of the issues which have to be implemented and maintained for the betterment of trains in India. Even the government has to allot some amount of money for the proper maintenance of trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
