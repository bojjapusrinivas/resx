India can also produce reputed entrepreneurs of shure. In India due to lack of oppurtunity many times our entrepreneurs lose the chance to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, &amp;nbsp;there are many good entrepreneures are available, like Deheeru Bhai Ambani, Mukesh Ambani. They have an excelent quality of running bussiness. They worked very hard to raise their bussiness, and they are counted in the World best entrepreneures. Due to their bussiness skills, day by day they were keep growing with their bussiness and reaching towards success. Many big world class industries are produce by the these mens. They have good reputation in the world for their success.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t say India does not produce good entrepreneures. India also has capability to produce world best entrepreneures. India just need to do hard work with their upcoming voluntrees. India can do best and better to develope their bussiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India has so many well equipted &amp;nbsp;international Bussiness schools. These schools helps India to produce good entrepreneures. Quality of education provided in these schools is the best. Indian students have the great oppurtunity to get admission in these schools and inprove their skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Indian Bussiness schools, a big drawback is that, these schools demands a huge amount of money to get admission on them. It will cause middle class students to loose oppertunity to learn in these schools. &amp;nbsp;Lots of fee is the major problems with the Bussiness schools. Due to so high fee, many students are not going for B-ussiness Schools. It cause India to loose many of good coming entrepreneures in the light. Government should do something to increase the oppurtunity to get the intrested students admitted into the bussiness schools and let them to learn. So that these students apply their skills in correct manner and gain success in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning, helps to use our skills in correct manner. Once student gain the knowledge, he can use his knowledge to work through his skills. Bussiness needs lots of experience and knowlwdge to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneure means the one who do the bussiness and grow his bussiness. Everyone is entrepreneur, every day we get some idea to do something special. Day to day schedule teach us to be act like an entrepreneure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is &amp;nbsp;not far away to produce good entrepreneures, it is just lagging behind in some of the skills of providing knowledge. &amp;nbsp;A bussiness school produce lacks of students every year who can be the best entrepreneure of the coming generation. Indian bussiness school of Ahembdabad is the most famous one in the world. From all over the world students are coming to India to learn bussiness skills. But our indian students are not coming forward because of lack of money or may be lack of knowledge in this field. We should take advantage of such highly equipted, well managed bussiness schools and make aware all intrested Indian students about these schools and develope with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, students are not much aware of bussiness and marketing fields. Only upper class people are aware of bussiness. In India, we can see the trend that actor child will become actor, politician child wll become politition, sportsman child will become sportsman same with bussinessmen&amp;#39;s, child will become bussinessman. We should remove this trend in India and make everyone aware of everything, we should encourage the students who want to grow with the bussiness industry. We should provide good professional skills so that these students may take advantage of their knowledge and grow their skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will definately help India to produce &amp;nbsp;the world&amp;#39;s best entrepreneures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
