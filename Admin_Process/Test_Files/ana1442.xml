<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/28/2014 4:17:04 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering the present state of Indian economy, outline five key agendas for the newly formed Central Government.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The resent elections that took place in India was a critical election for not only the political parties as well as the people of the country. The election was mainly focused on the youth and the first time voters which could actually change the future of the country, in the resent past we have witnessed many scams&amp;nbsp;of the political parties due which&amp;nbsp;people start loosing faith in the government and that inversely effected the countries economy , as people started loosing faith in the government which actually have to work in the favor of the people is not working for the they stoped the investment in the financial market and that led to a major down fall of the economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Due&amp;nbsp;these many scams in&amp;nbsp;the country the&amp;nbsp;other country started loosing faith in the&amp;nbsp;Indian economy which resulted in&amp;nbsp;less exports and&amp;nbsp;more imports due to&amp;nbsp;which inflation&amp;nbsp;arise. Due the inflation&amp;nbsp;the spending nature of people changed and people started saving the money rather that spending it which in-turn stopped the flow of the money in the market due to which share market got down&amp;nbsp;and there were suddenly a panic situation in the&amp;nbsp;Indian economy, the prices of oils very very high , the prices of vegetables were very high and all other daily required commodities were also not available for the common man.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Another major issue of the crises in the&amp;nbsp;Indian economy is the black money which has no controll or no rules and regulation on it the past&amp;nbsp;government has failed to bring back the&amp;nbsp;black money which can actually solve the crises of the Indian Economy many social organizations tried to introduce a bill that can actually catch the culprits for the black money but the past government was itself&amp;nbsp;corrupt hence it did not allow the bill to be passed .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The new Government which was elected by the&amp;nbsp;youth of this nation has elected it believing that a new change will come in the country the major and the foremost challenge for the new government is of bring back the black money to the country which is a key factor for reducing the inflation and stabilizing the economy. The new government&amp;nbsp;has full knowledge of what people of India wants&amp;nbsp;because they were in the apposition for more than 10 years they&amp;nbsp;know what mistakes the past government had done and how to overcome them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The new Government also has a challenge to&amp;nbsp;increase the exports in different fields and to decrease the imports. Another major challenge is to compete in the global economy the new government has promised that India will be in the race for Developed&amp;nbsp;countries and not&amp;nbsp;anymore be called a under developed country .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The backbone of the Indian economy is farming and farming is getting reduced day by day many farmers are taking a drastic step of suicide because of the major issues like no power supply when required,. high interest rates of banks for loans, very less ground water and water supplied from outside, very low buying rate in the market for the yield etc. hence the major contribution to the Indian economy comes from the framers so if farmers get their basic need&amp;nbsp;on time we&amp;nbsp;can save&amp;nbsp;our economy in time. Unemployment is also a factor that actually effects the economy of the particular country if unemployment is more in a country the economy of the country is in a state of danger hence the new government has to create more and more&amp;nbsp;opportunities for the youth that can save the economy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
