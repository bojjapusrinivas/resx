Discuss with examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; According to me modern inventions have made the life simple as well as dangerous. Invention have developed very much in the world and&amp;nbsp;We Human Beings are more depended on the technology very much. Without technology our life would be very miserable. Invention are something which make the things to be done easy and at the same time its also dangerous.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Invention is nothing but the development of technology around us. In the present era the invention plays a major role. Without these invention our life would have become miserable in this generation. There are many inventions which made the human life simple and easy. At the sane time there are things which had&amp;nbsp;made the human life complex. Invention is something new to the world.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The invention of nuclear weapons are used to protect the country from various situations but there are many misuse happening which&amp;nbsp;cost the life of people.&amp;nbsp;There was a case&amp;nbsp;happened which&amp;nbsp;cost the life of many people i.e. Hirushima and&amp;nbsp;Nagasaki. On&amp;nbsp;this case&amp;nbsp;the other country just to test the Bomb they had killed many people in&amp;nbsp;that place.&amp;nbsp;There&amp;nbsp;are many such cases which had made the lost of many things. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Human Beings are addicted to the&amp;nbsp;Invention&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the technology. The day we start beings with using the technology and the end with the technology. These inventions had made the human work simpler but at the same time lazy also. Cell Phone is invented for&amp;nbsp;better and easy communication.&amp;nbsp;But the&amp;nbsp;usage of this is taking to other level of life.&amp;nbsp;Every inventions&amp;nbsp;have their advantages and&amp;nbsp;dis-advantages. It depends on the person who uses the invention in his/her perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of technology has made a&amp;nbsp;drastic change in the world when compared to the past decade.&amp;nbsp;Example in the medical&amp;nbsp;field there&amp;nbsp;are some cases where no proper treatment available in the last decade. But in the present generation with the&amp;nbsp;help of the invention we are able to solve the critical cases easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The modern invention are Boom as well as the curse. Because it depends on the usage of the person.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
