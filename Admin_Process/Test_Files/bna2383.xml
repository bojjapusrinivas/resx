Discuss in detail the impact of training and development on employee job performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Performance plays a vital role for every person who wants to grow their career. In every organization the growth of an individual depends on the performance and the behaviour which plays a vital role for the individual to grow his career.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Every individual needs training in order to learn the things he has been hired for. Training palys a vital role in every individual`s life, without training no person can learn the things which he is required to do as a part of his duties at the workplace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Impact of training and development on employee job performance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;1) Training helps every individual to improve the skills required to do the job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;2) It helps the individual to know the correct method to do the job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;3) Every individual needs training so as to increase the knowledge required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;4) Every organization must provide employee development progarm in order to develop the skills of the individual and the growth as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;5) The development of any individual depends on them, every person has a different attitude and different personality so the development purely depends on the individual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Training and development are one of the curcial aspect for every individual to grow their career in any organization. The employer must provide training and development programs to the employees frequently which will help the individual to upgrade himself with the new technologies and the latest terms used in the market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The employer must always reward the individuals who perform well in the form of bonus or hike in the salary which will create a competitive atmosphere for the employees and help them to learn many new things they were not aware of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;There are many institutes which provide training and development workshops to the employees who lack the required skills to perfom the duties as per the employer. The training centers provide the individuals the required skills and also help them to accquire the job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The performance of every individual is claculated on the work done by him for the particular year or month. The quality is taken into consideration of every employee in the organization and the best employee is rewarded. The quality can be only maintained if proper training is provided to the individual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rise in high elevated&amp;nbsp;buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue till date. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many segments. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
