What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;To each his own. Thats one of our favorites among all idioms we use and get to hear more often than we&amp;#39;d like, but i have always wondered and yes, been perplexed as a child and even now ,as to how does greed,jealousy,gossip,inferiority/superiority &amp;nbsp;complex and other unmentionable more social issues rise if each should be or is left to &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; own. There have to be differences. Differences that make people want more; differences that make people feel a certain social discomfort. Say, I have a laptop and a mobile with wifi acccess everywhere i go, and when during summers my cousin ask me to visit my aunt in Jabalapur, Madhya pradesh (Which, in no way is rural) I fear being seperated from constant internet access. This is something extremely trivial. And personal hence unimportant to many. But its a start isnt it ?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Benefits is such a wide term. Its also a superficial term for me. Benefits are given to employees, to customers,to participants, to hotel guests... Thus, in a superficial sense Yes it is a fact that Big Cities offer much more and much colorful and enchanting benefits than rural areas. We have the metro here, the shopping complexes , the umpteenth malls,the Janpaths and the Sarojinis, the salons capable of turning a frog into princes and princess..This list cant be exhausted. Not to forget, The great and oh-so-loved drainage systems and the magical procelin that carries our sins below the city. All these are basic things that a rural setting would fail to provide. To be kind, all these facilities though now said to be available , I&amp;#39;m sure are not upto the mark we have been made used to or taught to define as the acceptable standards. We humans crave comfort and ease. There are apps for you to turn off your lights that you can download off the internet! Need i say more?&amp;nbsp; In view of all this said and understood and frowned upon..the honest truth is..Rural areas wont please many.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As I took the liberty of tainting &amp;quot;benefits&amp;quot; as a superficial term earlier , i am going to justify my thought process. There are infact benefits in urban areas, of various things from basic banking facilities to insurance for all imaginable living and non living things, to ease of commuting , endless opportunities to earn and many many more. But is there peace in all this? I have always heard my parents talk about their desire to shift to a more rural setting once they retire. It makes me wonder if in fact we should,if at all, try to eliminate the disparity between the two faces of India. We have been successful in providing the basic amenities like water, electricity, roads,internet and healthcare facilities to our poorer counterparts. Now if there is an infuse of all these facilities,at its own slow questionable rate though, why question the disparity among them?&amp;nbsp; What can be done is different question all together. Given that so many things are already being said and done to eliminate the differences in urban and rural areas, a few pointers from my side would include :&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;First, employement opportunities through various schemes,instituition set-ups, industrialisation etc. Larger the number of jobs available for people amongt their people,lesser the issues of rural overflow in urban areas and lesser the crimes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Second, and highly important given our present scenerio, removing the disparity is the mindset of the residents of urban and rural areas is of utmost important. I understand if provided with what all need, the aggression spewing from the daily struggles can and are eliminated bringing more to citizens and the nation as a whole in terms of our Human Development Index. But isnt it time we change our oldage-stricken methodologies?&amp;nbsp; Eating noodles causes rapes? Do i need the disparity in terms of shiny black roads or air conditioned malls lessened more than the differences in our views? Its a rhetorical question, just incase. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India has two faces, the one that works with the new age tools and helps pump money in our economy giving a a globalised stature and the other using tools of the Gods to feed the soldiers. Both are a part of One whole. Lagging behind of any one of these would render India diasbled. It is required that they both flourish with the ever running time. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
