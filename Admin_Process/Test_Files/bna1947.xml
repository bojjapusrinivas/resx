<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/27/2015 5:09:17 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are living in information era,where computer plays a major role.In different sectors of industries the use of computers is massive,where the whole system of a firm is dependent for its day to &amp;nbsp;day work on computers.Large content procurement,data storage,retreiving and calculations,business communications are done using computer systems.Not only these but a local firm is able to expand its business to different regions and corners of the world using computers aided with internet and communication facilities.With this we can understand the importance of computers and its significance in our economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contribution of computer does not end here, as not only the firms, industries and government bodies depend on computers for their routine work but also an individual &amp;nbsp;is dependent on computers not only for his/her &amp;nbsp;professional work but is &amp;nbsp;also dependent on computers for fullfillment of personal tasks and growth of skills and knowledge .Today man is dependent on computer systems as much as he is dependent on oxygen to breath his life.Be it a lay man booking &amp;nbsp;tickets for big movies, a student studying online,a customer doing survey about a product for purchasing it,storing personal data like documents,making documents,images,music...etc..he needs a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although heavy in size, this massive use of computers is continuing in the 21st century even after the inventions of new technical devices &amp;nbsp;such as smart phones,i-pad,i-phone ,memory storage devices..etc..because these devices are limited in data storage where as computer provides storage of large data and retrieval of data,it also provides more applications than a smart phone provides.Even the number of external connections of a computer are more compared to a smart phone though the smart electronic devices are compact. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the use of computers it laid a basic foundation of human and economic growth in terms of business and knowledge.With rapid growth of technology we may witness more advanced computer systems which wil make life and business tasks more easy.But &amp;nbsp;the growth may not be completely positive.With the massive use and growing dependency on computers man is becoming lethargic,brain work is less as computers do calculations,probability of employment for less skilled workers is reducing with more use of computers.Not only these issues but we are also concerned with the health of an individual operating the system.As he/her is personally and professionally dependent on the computers for almost every task of life,thus spending more time on computer.Many individuals who operate on system complain about health issues such as growing eyesight at young age,spinal cord ache,wrist pain...etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the &amp;nbsp;the subject of "Ergonomics" is gaining importance,it is difficult to solve these issues as personal relations are also being affected with dependency on computer systems,as people prefer communicating on a computer system rather than personally meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With rapid growth of technology and competition the use and dependency on computers is inevitable,but not impossible.Hence,can say that,for growth and effecient fulfillment of tasks we should use the computers but we should not let the computers take over human beings well being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:SouthKorea2013EconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Koreas`s economy seems to be growing and is very likely to see the boost in current years compare to the past.The push up in economic indicators and formulation of policies seem to be the reason of economic growth witnessed in the first quarter of 2013 with two year high GDP growth.This push up in economic indicators is mainly due to the growth of construction,investments and exports.More growth in these can be predicted in the coming quaters as more liberalisation of fiscal and monetary policies is intended.Though the average consumption has also witnesed growth because of low unemployment,low inflation and is soon to see the upward movement.Aiding to the growth is the upward movement of global trade cycle and also increase in the exports of South Korean products to other European countries,which means an overall effective growth of the South Korean economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Korean economy is predeicting more growth seeing improving prospects for industry and consumer spending ,because &amp;nbsp;of the economic activites getting a boost from growth of industrial profits.This economy is expecting more growth in coming years as its profits in both domestic and foriegn markets are seeing consistent growth which is again showing good impact on industries.With is growth the the inflation will see a cut encouragi9ng the consumer to spend more ,showing this is the index of &amp;nbsp;104 in May from 102 in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push, that is the fiscal and monetary policies supporting the economic system,the decision of the governing bodies to aid the medium and small nscale enterprises by allocation of $4.8 billion is giving good stimulus for industrial growth and see overall growth of South Korean economy ahead.The rate of employement will also increase with this industrial growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thses all rising factors show the growth of South Korean economy ahead of the Japanese conomy,which is third largest economy contributing for economic growth all over the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
