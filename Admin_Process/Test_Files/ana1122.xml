What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The development of a country&amp;nbsp;will be assessed by three basic&amp;nbsp;needs Education, Shelter and Medical facilites&amp;nbsp;availabe to the&amp;nbsp;common people.Of these, health care supply is most essential. But here, the questin arises&amp;nbsp;that &amp;quot;does it possible to provide&amp;nbsp;these basic needs&amp;nbsp;specially health care&amp;nbsp;supply&amp;quot; to our country&amp;nbsp;which is 2nd&amp;nbsp;highest populated country in the world with approximately 121 crore people&amp;nbsp;according to the 2011 census.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In India, there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. India is a very diversified country with different cultural people. India, with&amp;nbsp;28 states&amp;nbsp;and 7 union territories&amp;nbsp; has a unique&amp;nbsp;status.&amp;nbsp;Each state&amp;nbsp;has its&amp;nbsp;own culture, language&amp;nbsp; social conditions and ethical values.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;environment&amp;nbsp;affects the life of people a lot.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;Govt. shold make a policy &amp;amp; regulate strictly preserving the forest areas and environment. it should contain atleast 33% of&amp;nbsp;land under forest deportment. The schedule trible people mostly depend on these areas&amp;nbsp;to lead their life. The increase in population, causing for deforestation. they are cutting&amp;nbsp;trees and&amp;nbsp;using it for agricultural purpose. It&amp;nbsp;causes for many environmental distrubances. The 60% of people of India are living in villages. where people are not accessable to techonology and medical facilities. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Though, the&amp;nbsp;Governament is very much concern about health of people and making policies, but they are not reaching the&amp;nbsp;poor&amp;nbsp;and needed people. Many of the villages dont have&amp;nbsp;transport&amp;nbsp;facilites, hospitals, a few with lack of human resources.The advanced techonogical methods shoud be introduced&amp;nbsp;and Strategic planning&amp;nbsp;should be made. In remote areas&amp;nbsp;it is possible to establish many hospitals under publlic private partnership.&amp;nbsp;The mobile hospital may help to resolve this issue. Many of the people are living under poverty, they are&amp;nbsp;uneducated and beliving in superstitions not&amp;nbsp;going to&amp;nbsp;hospitals.The people are not aware of&amp;nbsp;many diseases. They must be&amp;nbsp;educated and&amp;nbsp;conduct awareness programs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Providing helath care facilities is the responsibility of any elected Governament. It is the right of every Indian.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
