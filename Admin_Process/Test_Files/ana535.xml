Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many sectors which influence the economic condition of our country like agriculture sector,Finance sector and many more. In my opinion oil sector plays the most important role in driving the economic condition of a country. From time immemorial oil and crude has played a most crucial driving force for our economic condition of our country. Everything depends on the oil. Though India is not the major producer of the oil but it plays a very important role in defining the economic condition of our country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Be it our own car, public transport, the CNG, LPG, Diesel, all electric equipments that run on oil like generator...and many more..hence oil is very important to run these otherwise our lives would come to standstill.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Inflation depends on oil industry. But nowadays everymonth we come to hear that petrol and diesel prices have gone up or down..and people out of agony can do nothing against the government as the prices are soaring of each and every commodity. Be it Raw vegetables or any other commodity that requires transportation is going out of reach of a common man since prices are very high. Vegetables which used to cost Rs. 200 for 2 weeks&amp;nbsp;in 1990&amp;#39;s has rosen to 1000 Rs. Vegges for one week. The price of commuting has gone high. The auto whch at a point of time were very cheap to travel are very expensive to travel now. For travelling 5 kilometers you have to shell out INR 25 for first 2 kms and then INR 8 for subsequent kms. Its better to travel by bus and metro to save on individuals pocket since everything rises but salary does not increase.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As the prise rises the standard of living of the people also rises. They need more luxury goods day by day to enhance their standard of living and their status. Hence due to this richer is getting more richer and&amp;nbsp;poor is getting more poorer.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Their is fiscal deficit in the&amp;nbsp;economy. We pay taxes for our economic development but sarcastically they are used for filling government&amp;#39;s pocket.Recently everybody heard about armsgate, choppergate. Railgate and in near future there will be oilscam. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If we look bach into our indian history, jawaharlal nehru, mahatma gandhi have given our econmic condition a new edge. The biggest example is the east Indian Company. They threw the britishers out of india. And when they died our indian econmy is in engraving sitaution day by day.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
