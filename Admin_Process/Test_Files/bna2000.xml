<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/23/2015 5:08:53 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological advancements and ever-changing work policies provide people with an option to work from home, rather than the office where they meet the team face to face. List out and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the advancements in technology the society is undergoing a radical and fast change, one of which is the work from home option. Work from is one policy which assists the employees to work from home. Work from home provides the advantage for the employees to sit in their&amp;nbsp;comfort zone and work on the projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Advantages: Working from home enables an employee to make better use of the time which he have. It enables the people to allot maximum amount of their time to the work which they are doing. One of the important aspects of working from home is that an employee can complete his work on time. People working late in the nights and who have assignments can make use of this work from home option if they do not have enough to complete their work during their office hours. They can feel comfort without any disturbance working at home. As time is a constrant in todays competitive world it would be better if an employee is given the permission to work from home. By working from home in free enivironmet an employee can give best performance in doing the job. The employees can utilize thier free time at home to accomplish the assignments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Disadvantages: One of the important and foremost drawback of working from home is that they loose the face to face interaction. In todays age of Industrialization and Globalization, the employees need to workk in teams to achieve the success. Most of the projects success depends on the team is performing rather than an single individual. A single individual can not handle a entire project by himself alone, he needs assistance from his subordinates and team members. Most of the projects today require the combined efforts of many empolyees. By working alone from the home, one cannot get the best ideas in handling and doing the project. When working in group along with the team members, one can get more number of suggesstions and ideas which would help in completing the job easily and successfully with 100% performance. Working from home can deviate an employees concentration as many issues will be there that would be revolving in his mind like the family matters, children, etc.,.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;As a coin would have two sides, everthing in this world will have both pros and cons. One need to utilize the opportunity provided to him/her properly. Working from home in addition to working at the office would help the company to complete the tasks on time, and it would be also helpful when the time available for the completing the task is aslo less. Although working from home seems to be resourceful and handy it may lead to less interaction and also one sided decisions which can have negative and also sometimes adverse effects. There may be certain work which requires only individuals efforts &amp;nbsp;and many people working on it can mislead the main objective. &amp;nbsp;Some other projects require a team effort for which many individuals are needed which cannot be performed from home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:ChinaEconomicOutlookfo2013&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the analysts were forecasting &amp;nbsp;an annual growth rate of 8-9 percent in China for the coming year, this may not be true because china as recorded only 7.7% of growth rate in the first quater and the government as also forecasted that the growth will be just 7.5% which was less than that of the previous year. The reason behind the government setting such a modest expectations were that there have been a decling labor force. There were certain issues which could contribute to the healthy growth of China like industrialization, urbanization but in a very big economy like China it is not an easy task to achieve. There were certain reforms anounced by the government but most of them remained relativey vague. Some other factors which China is facing are the raminification of large local government debt and considerable leverage in the shadow banking system. The weakness in the manufacturing activity also contributed to these worst case. Rising of wages had an adverse impact on the export markets which lead to the exodus of manufacturing capacity. Because of these reasons the growth rate even in the range of 7-8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China can change and improve its economic conditions by maitaining good relationship with the other countries. China`s government is now making efforts to join the Trans-Pasific Pact(TPP) which helps it in making to create a free trade area in the pasific basin. If china joins the group of 12 countries it would account to more than half of the global GDP. Free trade would &amp;nbsp;result not only in lowering the traffis and quotas but also would free up the domestic markets which can help them to compete with foreign companies. China believe that it would give a positive impact to its growth which would create pressure to the private state run companies, allowing the free movement of prices of goods and credit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China &amp;ndash; Economic Outlook for 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fast can China grow? That is the question underlying much of the discussion about China&amp;rsquo;s economy these days. Clearly, double digit growth is not in the cards and may even be a thing of the past. Growth of 7.7 percent in the first quarter was considered disappointing, and, until recently, many analysts were expecting growth to revert to the range of 8&amp;ndash;9 percent. Yet now the government appears determined to reset expectations. The government has forecast that growth this year will be 7.5 percent, a good deal lower than many private analysts had forecast only recently. That is certainly slower than the 7.8 percent growth in 2012, which was the slowest rate of growth in 13 years. Premier Li Keqiang, in a recent speech in Germany, said that growth for the remainder of the decade will average an even lower 7.0 percent per year. Although far slower than the growth experienced during the past two decades, Li indicated that China is &amp;ldquo;entering a range of reasonable growth.&amp;rdquo; Given that China has become a more mature economy with a declining labor force, Li is probably correct in setting more modest expectations. Moreover, growth of 7.0 percent is not bad: It doubles the GDP in 10 years. Li said that a combination of industrialization, urbanization, improvements in agricultural productivity, and investments in technology can contribute to healthy growth, and that this requires more market-oriented reforms. He also said that &amp;ldquo;for a very big economy, this is not easy.&amp;rdquo; When and how such reforms will be implemented remains uncertain. While some reforms have been announced, many government statements have been relatively vague. With a new regime just installed, it could take some time to build the support necessary to implement much needed reforms. In the interim, China faces some risks, including the ramifications of large local government debt, considerable leverage in the shadow banking system, and weaker-than expected manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing weakness stems from weakness in export markets. In addition, rising wages in China are having an adverse impact on export competitiveness, thereby leading to an exodus of manufacturing capacity. Thus, even growth in the range of 7&amp;ndash;8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further global integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves China&amp;rsquo;s economic relationship with the rest of the world. China&amp;rsquo;s government now says it will study the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP), an effort to create a free-trade area in the Pacific Basin. Currently there are 12 countries involved in this effort: the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. If China joins the group, the TPP will collectively account for more than half of global GDP. Freer trade would entail not simply lowering tariffs and quotas, although this would be an important component. It would also involve freeing up domestic markets so that they would have to compete freely with foreign companies. From China&amp;rsquo;s perspective, this could be a positive development in that it would create pressure to privatize state-run companies, create a level playing field for the private sector, and allow free movement of prices of goods and credit. Still, agreement on the TPP is probably a long way off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
