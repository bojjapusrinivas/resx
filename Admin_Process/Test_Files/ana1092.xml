What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India has got many good resources. Especially in the health care and hospitality. As we all know ayurveda has been first invented in India, which was later known to the whole world. So in the earlier days when technology was not known, people went for&amp;nbsp;a general treatment when a person is sick. That treatment was based on the medicines which was taken out from plants. Hence, through this ayurveda has come into existence. Even in our ethics, Lord Hanuman saved Laxmana through Sanjeevini which is a plant.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In the present scenario in India, there has been a huge gap between the healthcare supply and demand.&amp;nbsp;Due to the increase in polulation, there has been many diseases originated. People were facing many problems&amp;nbsp;especially poor people who are not able to afford for treatment. Usually the diseases were examined mainly in poor people, as they live in slum areas which are very unhygenic. In India there are also been many government hospitals arranged to help these kind of people. But there is no instant treatment provided for them and also&amp;nbsp;lack of resources compared to the private hospitals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The steps which government has to follow to improve patient care are:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* See that the resources are available instantly if it is an emergency.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Allocate funds so that it can offer better services for healthcare system.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Allocation of medicines should also be accessible for public.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Taking precautions, by creating an antibiotic to stop spreading of diseases.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* As diseases are spread mostly from unhygenic, so the primary step which government should take is maintaining the country clean and neat.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* In India, mostly the available of medicines are less. So the government has to concentrate more on availability of medicines. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* To provide a better treatment, there need to be professional doctors. So young people should be &amp;nbsp;encouraged by providing them education.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Hospitals are need to be arranged within the accessible distance for the general public.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Free treatment need to be provided&amp;nbsp;for poor people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Planting more trees will generate peaceful mind and decreases the cause of diseases. Hence government need to plant trees besides the roads.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The major aspect to increase the patient care is by arranging frequent campaigns like free checkup like dental, sugar, B.P etc across the country. It is better to arrange &amp;quot;POLIO DROPS&amp;quot; for children once in every 3 months, as children can be easily effected with the diseases. Free health care and hospitality campaigns need to be arranged in every city and village.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As India is having the highest illiteracy rate, so the government need to educate people regarding the technology and also available of resources for them. Hence these are the major aspects where government need to pay more attention to improve the patient care in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
