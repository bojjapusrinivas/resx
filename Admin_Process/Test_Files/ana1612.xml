<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;7/24/2014 4:03:33 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For India to progress, do we really need smaller states? What has been the performance of small states that were carved out previously from large states? Have they fulfilled the demands of the people or is it just plain power politics at play? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; According to me, in this case there are both advantages and dis advantages. Before going to the topic I want to give an example of a recent state division, i.e. Andhra Pradesh re-organisation.&amp;nbsp;Now the state was divided into two- as Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Telangana, the 29 th state of India. These states were divided in a very rigorous way.&amp;nbsp;The division&amp;nbsp;was not done&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;correct process. Because, one reason I can say for&amp;nbsp;example is the topic of Hyderabad. The people in government before developed Hyderabad in different ways like - IT hubs, Hospitals, Educational Institutions,&amp;nbsp;Airport, Parks, Temples, Roads, etc. They have developed only Hyderabad but not other districts. Here is the actual problem arraises i.e. development of one single district.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now, when the state had divided, Hyderabad belongs to Telangana state. And the people of Andhra Pradesh are not ready to leave Hyderabad as it is highly developed. So there were many issues at the time of state division. The bill has been&amp;nbsp;passed in a worst way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now coming to the actual topic, according to me small states are necessary for&amp;nbsp;faster development. Even before there were such issues like state divisions&amp;nbsp;and now the are in good growth&amp;nbsp;and the developed&amp;nbsp;fast.&amp;nbsp;There are many advantages when states were divided. some of them are- &amp;nbsp;Employment increase,&amp;nbsp;development of education, hospitals,&amp;nbsp;rural areas,&amp;nbsp;etc. And some of the dis advantages are - increase in bribe, less development for poor, positive sign for politicians in their growth, etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In other way, its being a political play.&amp;nbsp;The demands of the people are not fulfilled. Small states leads to the growth of bribe.&amp;nbsp;Because there will be a faster development process in all sectors like agriculture,&amp;nbsp;industrial, services, etc. so there will be a good&amp;nbsp;sign for the growth of bribes. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So&amp;nbsp;what I can say is good people are always good. But those who are bad should strive to be good then only development takes place in a better way. Unless they change country cannot be changed.&amp;nbsp;Sometimes people don&amp;#39;t change even if anyone motivates them. Such people should develop the concept of self motivation. Then only&amp;nbsp;change occurs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
