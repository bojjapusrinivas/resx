Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, attitude is important thing. After creating awareness about the topic .They should feel resposible towards doing the action sucessful.One of the latest campaign started by government of India "Swach Bharat" for cleanliness of the society . There has been a great promotion of the campaign,there are some great steps taken by government too for making the society&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;If action is good but our attitude towards the cleanliness is not &amp;nbsp;good then it is of no use. we being the part of the society it should be our basic resposibility to keep our society clean. For example Father of our nation Mahatma Gandhji he himself used keep the surrondins of the sabarmathi asram clean and green. If people know what is good and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;What I think everything relays on the attitude of the people &amp;nbsp;. If people of the society are having the postive attitude towards anything then it will be easy to the government to make any thing succesful. There is an intiative taken by the government of Telanagana towards the cleanliness of the Hyderabad with the campaign called "Swach Hyderabad".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;There is good example in the our society that the attitude is more important than the movement .Is that cleanliness of river Ganga people are dumpimg so much of waste in it attitude of people should change that they keep our rivers clean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Finally I would like to conclude that - Along with the attitude there should be the minimum amout of action should be performed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
