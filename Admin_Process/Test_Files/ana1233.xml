Each and &amp;nbsp;every individual has to thing about our country and it&amp;#39;s growth. Now a days no youth is thinking about development of the country and politics of the country.&amp;nbsp;They are spending&amp;nbsp;their time in some other areas like movies and drinking.&amp;nbsp;But in our country old&amp;nbsp;are ruling.&amp;nbsp;So that they don&amp;#39;t have enough energy to lead the country move forward. So that we are missing&amp;nbsp;many things, and opportunities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Present in our country,&amp;nbsp;we don&amp;#39;t have good politics and political leaders as well. The leaders&amp;nbsp;became selfish. They are committing to corruption and encouraging people to be corrupted. No politician thinking about his responsibilities,&amp;nbsp;but they are trying to secure their positions. Before elections&amp;nbsp;their commitments are different and after election their attitude is different. They are taking their&amp;nbsp;position for granted. So that our India is still stepping back. If we continue this same politics and same leaders&amp;nbsp;our country will not be developed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So,&amp;nbsp;the growth of the country is in the hands of the youth.&amp;nbsp;Youth have time,&amp;nbsp;energy, and talent. So if the&amp;nbsp;youth use their talent in the way that that&amp;nbsp;we want, our country will develop. So youth have to contribute their talents to the development of the country.&amp;nbsp;They have to utilize the resources of our country. We have many natural resources like revers, seas, lands. We have many chances to be developed. So as youth we should no neglect our country. We are the weapons for our country. So we should think about our current politics which is being led by our leaders.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Our growth is in our hands, so we also should enter into the politics and change the total system of the politics. Then only we will be use full vessels.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
