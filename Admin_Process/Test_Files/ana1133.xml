What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India is one of the developing country in the world, and in&amp;nbsp;India&amp;nbsp;there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand because&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;is highly populated in order to over come this gap government has to take following steps.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Encourage pharma&amp;nbsp;industry in India so that we can stop importing medicines from foreign countries.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should take proper care about the utilization of the available medicines in proper way that is proper inspections must be conducted to ensure that the medicines are delivered to common man.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should focus on preventing the spread of viral fever rather than curing them, because &amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;prevention is better than curing&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should focus on rural and remote areas because they are far away from the development and also create awareness among them so that they will approach the near by health centre rather than going for the traditional methods .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should focus on providing low price medicines and also off&amp;nbsp; some discount on particular medicines so that it will not become a burden for common man, because there few medicines which a common man cannot effort them to buy and use them till the end of the course period as they are very costly.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should establish one health research centre of each and every district so that they can monitor all the issues from there, because the there&amp;nbsp;are some particular type of viral fevers which are found only in some parts of the country, by identifying those areas they can increase the amount of medicines to that particular area, and also they can conduct research and find out the root cause for that.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should create awareness among the people regarding different types of diseases which can be spread from one person to another like HIV/AIDS.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should increase the quality of services offered by them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Even though we have separate department and health minister for this there is lack of cooperation and coordination between different level of employees, government should ensure all these things, and they should take proper care and reduce the misuse of these medicines.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should also create awareness about what type of food has to be consumed by them so that can resist themselves from any foreign bodies and increase their immunity.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
