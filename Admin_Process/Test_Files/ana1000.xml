Discuss with examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; In my view ,in this digital era invention of different types of software and new forms of electronic gadgets made our life&amp;#39;s simpler to get communicated and get the works done in an accurate manner.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Coming to some of the modern inventions that have been invented in the recent times are like mobiles with some sophisticated software that have been developed like android with touchscreens etc. that are being used in our day to day life everyday.These are making our communication very easier than in the old days such as availing internet ,&amp;nbsp;that could enable us doing our work from the place where we are like mobile banking,making any bill payments etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mostly in this digital era, many inventions and modifications of existing one&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;s had taken place in different fields such as invention of notebooks, tablets, smartphones etc. in the field of computers and pc&amp;#39;s. Many more important inventions are being done in some industries like car manufacturers, aerospace industry, steel and cargo industries, electronics manufacturers etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; By using all these inventions we stepped forward in the invention&amp;nbsp;of technology and its usage that made our standards of living simpler as well as easier.This digital era not only made livelihood very easy but also complex in some aspects of our life.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is making our life complex and even dangerous in some situations of our lives we are facing now a days. Such as failure in maintaining human relations with others. This is happening because human are mostly getting engaged with electronic gadgets and their own work in their daily life that could effect their relations with their family and neighbours that would be&amp;nbsp;causing a&amp;nbsp;great damage to the society in maintaining relations and unity among the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is even effecting our next generations to get communicated with our own people because of our busy schedule in the daily life. This would through a person in to lonely situation where he should starve for breaking loneliness and get peace of mind.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This era not only effecting human relations but also environment directly that is causing lot of damage to the global biodiversity cycle, due to the inventions made in this era such as vehicles, refrigerators, air conditioners, mobiles and some other electronic gadgets and machinery etc. used for different purposes is causing global warming that is effecting the biodiversity cycle of the environment that is effecting all the living beings on the earth as well.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So due to this&amp;nbsp; digital era living beings are even thrown in to the dangerous situations by causing global warming that effects the eco system and livelihood on the earth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Finally, this digital era&amp;nbsp;is having both advantages and disadvantages due to the inventions made in this period of time.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This would become an advantage when it is utilized up to the extent it is required and in the suitability ratio to the maintenance of eco system healthier.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This would become an disadvantage when it is utilized more than the extent required and that could cause damage to the eco system and earths biodiversity that will be effecting all the living beings on the earth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hence usage of the new inventions&amp;nbsp;must be encouraged up to the extent they are required and not causing any damage to the eco system and through us&amp;nbsp;on to the border&amp;nbsp;of the dangerous situations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
