&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;many people working at home &amp;nbsp;complain of isolation and lonliness as they cannot talk to their boss and cowokers &amp;nbsp;can make a person depress. although office distractions are avoided by working at home, different distractions may arise like interruptions from children, neighbours, family friends etc because of this we may make mistakes in our work. since there is no one looking over your work hours we may feel tempted to work endlessly. peoplle may become lazy to complete their work as they are working from home.work cannot be completed on time. &amp;nbsp;if &amp;nbsp;we have any doubts regarding anything we cannot take suggestions. there is no person to help us in giving solutions and through this we may end up by making mistakes in our work. the danger of being &amp;nbsp;overlooked for promotions and carrrer development &amp;nbsp;oppurtunities is quite real when we are away from office and other more visible employees are actively waiting for the promotions. we may not be aware of all these. working from home allowes us to work in team , make new friends and enjoy the corporate life outside. woking from home is not for anyone . it takes a lot of dedication and self -control and the discipline to motivate yourself to preserve in working at home alone over the long run without having any distractions &amp;nbsp;and losing drive and momentum. often a partial agreement where we report into the office once or twice a weekis the optimal arrangement as it allowes close interactions with colleagues and supervisors and ensures us to remain in touch with company developments while still permitting us the comfort and convinence of working from home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013GlobalAutoIndustryOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentared all over the world as 90% of the total vehicles are sold in the U.S. the first 5 months of 2013 general motors had a large market share of 18% in the U.S. toyota motors corp which had a large market share than general motors in 2012 &amp;nbsp;as they sold 9.75 million vehicles globally &amp;nbsp;but had a less market share of 14.2% in 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;To&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;achieve more automakers will have to keep designing vehicles that satisfies the customers and attract them by giving them at low-cost. example, ford motors uses " one manufacturing" strategy which produces mutltiple products across the world to save the production costs due to fast changes in costomers tastes. The automakers go to different regions like china, india and south america where thet can lower the cost of production that producing it in higher regions like northamerica and europe. governement also plays a significiant role. automakers have to produce according to the policies of the governement. many auto making companies like FORD,GM, BMW, HONDA, JAGUAR and many more have signed commitment letter with the US Governement that they will raise the standard of fuel economy and light -duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 &amp;ndash; Global Auto Industry Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In the first five months of 2013, General Motors Company ( GM ) led with a 18.0% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. ( F ) with a 16.4% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. ( TM ) with a 14.2% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 11.7% market share, and Honda Motor Co. ( HMC ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( NSANY ) at the last spots with 9.5% and 8.1% market shares, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;OPPORTUNITIES &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;To remain competitive, the automakers will need to design vehicles that will cater to consumers in both mature and emerging markets while manufacturing them at low-cost using the most advanced technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;For example, Ford has undertaken "One Manufacturing" strategy, which aims at producing multiple models from plants across the world in order to save production costs and fast adaptation to changes in consumer tastes. The automaker anticipates producing 4.5 models at each of its plants by 2015, up from 3.6 models currently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Further, the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features (which will save money on gas), even on the small and less gas-guzzler vehicles in order to attract buyers. The sale of optional features is helping them offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to large trucks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The automakers continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. According to a study by CSM Worldwide, China and South America together will represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The role of governments is highly significant. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years. In late 2011, 13 major automakers, including Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Volvo, have signed letters of commitment with the U.S. Government to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
