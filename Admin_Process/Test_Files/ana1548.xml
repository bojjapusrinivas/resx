To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There are various&amp;nbsp;forms of mass media, which include television, radio, and newspapers. Media acts as a communication channel by updating viewers regarding the latest news&amp;nbsp;which are happening around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In the present generation, media has a major influence in shaping&amp;nbsp;people&amp;#39;s idea. I completely agree with this statement. Considering an example, most of the cine stars use mass&amp;nbsp;media as a source to promote their movies. The movies are marketed using all forms of media in such a way that the viewers are compelled to watch the movie. Many regional movies are&amp;nbsp;advertised&amp;nbsp;using various forms of media as super hit on the very next day of&amp;nbsp;its release, which isn&amp;#39;t true but it has a major influence on&amp;nbsp;the viewers. People are influenced by the promotions and rush to cinema hall to watch the movie, many movies have benefited using mass media as a tool to have a better reach to the&amp;nbsp;public.&amp;nbsp;Thus, I would like to say that media has a&amp;nbsp;thought provoking&amp;nbsp;impact on the general public.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Media is an powerful source, if used in a right way it is a boon but if misused it is a&amp;nbsp;bane. Media has&amp;nbsp;ability to inject thoughts into people which can&amp;nbsp;make or break a person&amp;#39;s image. Hence, I can summarize that media must&amp;nbsp;always be used for the betterment of the society by&amp;nbsp;educating viewers&amp;nbsp;on what&amp;#39;s happening around the world&amp;nbsp;in an unbiased way. Media must always be for the people, by the people and of the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
