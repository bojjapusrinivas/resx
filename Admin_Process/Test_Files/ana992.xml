What do you think are the major steps that can be taken in present circumstances to push growth in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indian economy is being followed based on the articles in the constitution the economy of India is very poor compare to the other countries the resources used are more than producing and the type of government in our country is not developed due to that many problems are faced by the common people due to the scarcity of the things that a common man needed in his day to day life are increased a lot &amp;amp; cost of living is extended and the production of the things is reduced and there is rising in the cost of prices.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We can take a best example of agriculture sector the farmers are producing and due to some of the external reason like floods and many other reasons there is a scarcity of goods and in that case the resources are produced very less and the cost of resources are increased a lot.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Not only in agriculture sector but in all the areas the Indian economy is lacking and day by day the value of the rupee is falling down.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The effective steps that should be taken to improve our Indian economy is:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The people in the government&amp;nbsp;should take some effective steps so that our Indian economy can be in a good position 1st the people in the government should work for the economy not for sake of them all the different people in different sectors take some preventive measures so that they could not face&amp;nbsp;any kind of&amp;nbsp;problems which occur internally the main and the most important thing is that planning if planning is effective and the outcome that they get will also be effective so that there will be the growth and some of them who are not knowledge able&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;implementing some programs and by letting them to know so that they can work effective it can be mainly taken in the agriculture sector so that they can know &amp;amp; implement it so that we can see some growth in that&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;the rupee value is falling day by day and rate of the dollar is increasing because of the economy the people who are here are not interested so they are working for other countries because they are not getting the pay what they are required for their skills if it is giving based on their skills their will be the growth in the particular sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I conclude by saying that&amp;nbsp;if there is an effective&amp;nbsp;planning and implementation in all the areas that can lead to the growth of the Indian economy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
