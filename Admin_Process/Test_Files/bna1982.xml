To what extent do you agree with this statement? Provide reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environment Conservation and protection is the demand of time. It is crucial not only for sustainable development of society but also for the very existence of humanity. Nature along with providing habitation, nurtures us and fulfills all our existence related necessecities. For the fact that nature complements us in every aspect, it is the responsibilities of humans to preserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the time human civilization started, the natural resources are being exploited both positively as well as negatively. The indicators of human development such as the establishment of habitations, construction of work-centres, infrastructures building all take inputs from one single source, " The Nature Itself". Any aspect of development including Economic and infrastructural planning of an area should be inclusive of the idea of Environment Conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the current mushrooming state of infrastructural construction, it will be surprising to know what we have sacrificed to get into that state. The loss the environment is facing is severing. There are very big economies such as China, The US, Japan and various others where the infrastructre building is rampant. But along with this growth, the process contributed the nature negatively.The issues such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Warming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green House Effects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozone Layer Depletion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural Resources Depletion;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has created a hazardous efect in the environment. And if the trends of development without any concern to protect environment will follow, we will be hardly left with anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The businesses are more concerned with the profits and neglect the idea of nature protectionism. This immediate profit making is putting the harsh long term effects in shadow.But it`s never too late to start. Many businesses these days are realizing this fact and have come up with the ideas of Environment protection. The concepts of Go Green, Paperless Transactions, Say no to plastic bags are the proofs that people are realizing their responsibilities towards the nature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further strenthen my advocay of environment conservation, I put forward the following points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The natural resources crisis is in increasing trend, which if continue to grow will create a very hazardous situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. There are very few vegetations and more concrete jungles. This will make oygen, the base of human life, a scarce thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The world medical faternity has come up with many diseases because of the overexposure of UV rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Not only human beings the depletion of natural resources will create depletion of habitation of other life forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said this, I strongly believe that any economy to develop, prosper and sustain should take a step further and should be environment conscious. I won`t mind joining a Save Environment Campaign along with any other programs that works for the preservation of environment, at any time I would be provided with opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:SouthKorea2013EconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The economic indicators such as GDP, Inflation, Consumption patterns, Exports suggests that South Korea is in its way of becoming a Financial Giant. Consumption Spendings as one of the key components is reaping benefits from low unemployment and the real wages are rising because of sustantially low rates of inflation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Despite the indicators are showing improvements and the growth is supported by relaxed monetary policy, the investment patterns are not much satisfactory. And there is a chance that exports will be stagnant given the Eurozone Crisis and declining growth rates of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased production growth of 1.75 over year in April after two previous contraction and the expansion of manufacturing activity as suggested by purchasing managers` index figures are the evidence that there is an increment in industrial output. &amp;nbsp;The consumer sentiment measured by the Bank Of Korea`s composite sentiment index suggests that domestic as well as foreign consumption growth is high. The BOK`s composite consumer sentiment index is increased upto 104 to 102, in only a month of time. The trends in consumption growth is also accelerated by low unemployment and low inflation which further aids to real wage rate growth. And above all, the fiscal stimilus plan and monetary policy is acting as a catalyst to the growth of consumption and investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fiscal and monetary policy came up with the new $4.8 billion development plan that includes the agenda such as: aids to small and medium enterprises, increment in income, providing tax incentives, creating an investment-friendly environment. It is expected that these measures will increase the GDP growth by 0.35 along with the creation of 40000 jobs. The plan is a part of package of $15.4 billion supplementary plan which is supported by borrowings. Though there will be fiscal defecit, it will be completely controllable and manageable as there are low level of public debt, current account surplus and high total reserves comprising of 4323 billion excluding gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fiscal policy is supported by monetary policy as well. The BOK has decreased its policy rate by 25 basis point to strengthen Korean Won's against Japanese Yen given the friendly and decreased inflation rates. The BOK move will ultimately support the export competitiveness with Japan and contribute to S. Korea's growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
