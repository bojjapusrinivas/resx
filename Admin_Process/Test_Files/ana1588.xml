<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;7/24/2014 4:05:13 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For India to progress, do we really need smaller states? What has been the performance of small states that were carved out previously from large states? Have they fulfilled the demands of the people or is it just plain power politics at play?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Yes, I do believe that India should have smaller states to progress .........as we say&amp;nbsp;SMALL FAMILY HAPPY FAMILY (CHOTA PARIVAR SUKHI PARIVAR).There will be a large scope for growth and development for a smaller state than compare to a larger one. I think if the state is small the delegation of&amp;nbsp;power and responsibly, can be bone more efficiently and&amp;nbsp;required development can be done more effectively.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If the state is small decentralization of the power and &amp;nbsp;authority can be more&amp;nbsp;easy to solve&amp;nbsp;the day to day issues,&amp;nbsp; say regarding&amp;nbsp;employment, education or&amp;nbsp;food and shelter for the common man, can be looked after&amp;nbsp;easily and can be solved in a prescribed time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Coming to the reality&amp;nbsp;........yes we can see lot of&amp;nbsp;progress in smaller states&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the resent past. Even the present central government have passed so many good projects for the newly formed TELANGANA STATE. These major projects are going to be really&amp;nbsp;helpful for the progress&amp;nbsp;of the&amp;nbsp;newly&amp;nbsp;formed&amp;nbsp;state .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Yes&amp;nbsp;initially there will be problems with the&amp;nbsp;previous government&amp;nbsp;or there age old polies, but over a period of time&amp;nbsp;new government with new polies and new ideas &amp;nbsp;for a better living will defiantly&amp;nbsp;come in force for the common man.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Well coming to the demands of the people, they can not be fulfilled overnight by a newly formed state with a new ministry and all new agendas. As we can see there is lot of&amp;nbsp;scope for employment for the youth, the present&amp;nbsp;TELANGANA government have come up with some really good projects for&amp;nbsp;woman empowerment. If a state&amp;nbsp;has more woman educated and&amp;nbsp;empowered its&amp;nbsp;progress&amp;nbsp;is sure, as a old&amp;nbsp;saying ...........A&amp;nbsp;EDUCATED WOMAN IS&amp;nbsp;EQUAL TO A&amp;nbsp;UNIVERSITY as she can educate her entire family and&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;really change there life style which ultimately leads to the growth and development of that particular state.&amp;nbsp;Such kind of attention towards a particular class of the society is only possible with smaller states, so&amp;nbsp;India needs smaller states&amp;nbsp;for progress.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
