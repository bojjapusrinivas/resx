Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; Medical care in India is required to the greater extent. Every Year we are witnessing many people suffering because of the improper services or because of the lack of medical equipments and vaccinations. &amp;nbsp;The government should arrange medical campaigns and promote the necessity of the medical care. It is not only the responsibility of the government but also each and every individual should&amp;nbsp;be aware of the diseases and the appropriate measures to be taken by consulting the doctors. Inspite of frequent announcements by the central and state governments regargind few diseases people are neglecting their health issues and not gooing for medical checkups. we can observe initiatives taken to create awareness amongst citizens on swine flue vaccines. but the campaigns were not appropriate because of the lack of marketing as well as limitted vaccines availabe at limitted areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Coming to commercialization of medical industry. we can observe how commercialized the hospitals are now a days. patients treat the doctors as the visible god who give rebirth to them. But, doctors work for the money and even we saw many cases how doctors impose huge bills on small checkups. Say an example for small toothache issue or eye related isuues corporate hospitals are charging thousands and lakhs of rupees from their clients. For the same treatment if we go to the government hospitals there we can observe the negligence of the doctors towards patients and the lack of proper equipments and treatment. Many government doctors have started their private practice and to earn money. we can see the government doctors working with other corporate hospitals and setting up their own practice for their well being. We observed how comercialized the corporate hospitals are; Patients go to the doctors on trust and they make their patients to stay in hospital for more days to get the money from them not to render the service. To better describe how the corporate hospitals are working we can just quote the example how the movies are potraying the about the corporate hospitals. we can see how the doctors are working in hospitals in many movies like munna bhai mbbs and so on..&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;People believe that coorporate hospitals render better services and they go to the hospitals but thats not happening. so, according to my view point doctors in the government hospitals should treat properly rather than just working to earn money and even coming to coorperate hospitals they should not impose huge bills on their clinets and should treat them properly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Government and few of the corporate hospitals should take some initiateves like free medical checkups, campaigns and free vaccinations &amp;nbsp;to create awareness for the well being of indian citizens. The basic facilities should be provided at the government hospitals so that many people can opt for the government hospitals. we saw heights of commercialization at hospitals. we even saw patients bribing the office staff at hospitals for birth certificates. It should be controlled and for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
