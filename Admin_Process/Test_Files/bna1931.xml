<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/26/2015 5:10:46 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualified people from developing countries move to developed or rich countries in search of a better position, profile, work and money. Do you think this brain drain is making the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer? Discuss the pros and cons of brain drain, and measures to check this phenomenon? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I completely agree that rich countries are becoming richer and poor countries are becoming poorer because of Brain Drain. In developing countries like India, China, Bangladesh, Srilanka pakisthan people are getting graduation degree from home country and are going abroad to pursue further in developed countries. The qualified people from their home country are going to abroad to work for developed countries. this is leading developing countries in to vague. Developed countries are getting good qualified employees to work in their affiliated companies for cheaper pay. The pay role system in India has different consequences. Developed countries like UK and US using developing countries graduates to work for low cost which actually decreases the potentiality of the developing countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;People are desperate for better position and for high job profile. The manufacturing industries in our country are not giving higher pay roles as if the manufacturing companies possed in developed countries. As people are getting high profile jobs with high packages they often tend to show interest to work for other companies like mnc`s.According to developing countries should grab the graduated or high profiled people by attracting them with good opportunities. The venal system in developing countries plays vital role. The goverment of developing countries are not serious about the issue in order to take corrective measures to improve our economy. Inspite of being ossify minded i think goverment should take &amp;nbsp;step &amp;nbsp;forwrds to increase its GDP which plays a vital role for economy to get increase. grasping the young and dynami qualified talented graduates to work for the country plays a vital role. developing countires have to devise in such a way that they can attain a peaceful state where every one with in the country can actually being above proverty line. Although, it is important to be in proverty line to maintain inflation in the country in order to gain fdi- foreign direct investment, it is also important for a country to keep their wealth (qualified graduates) with in the country in order to increase countries economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Going further, qualified graduates are called wealth of the country. I say that they are actual resources for the country along with the natural resources which a country posess. Though their is a huge market and job opportunities and a higher play roles in abroad goverment of developing country can actually gain their qualified ones by giving high pay roles and by offereing high job profile to young graduates. For which developing countries actually need to have wide range of job opportunities. By providing job opportunities and also by increasing pay role developing countries can actually gain their qualified people to stay in their country. FDI plays a vital role to increase one`s economy where India is actually lagging behind when compared with china and Mexico. where they open opportunities for FDI in their country. In which our country is actually lagging behind in fear of loosing managing ability. The goverment should actually come forth to take corrective measures by opening new manufacturing industries in order to open up job opportunities for many qualified ones. and it also should give funds to young people who want to be enterprenuers, who actually want to Aver themselves to the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Strong pent-up demand due to aging vehicles on the U.S. roads along with falling unemployment rate have been the key factors in driving the auto sales in the U.S. Average age of vehicles on U.S. roads increased to 11.3 years in January 2013 from 10.8 years in 2012. Banks were also friendlier as they offered greater access to loans with lower interest rates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% to the five-year high of 14.5 million vehicles in 2012.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The present Eurozone financial crisis has adversely affected the operations of many global automakers, especially GM and Ford, who have a significant exposure to the market. Car sales in Europe continued to be low owing to weak consumer confidence on the back of a weak economy triggered by the crisis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;According to the European Automobile Manufacturers` Association (ACEA), car sales in Europe reached its lowest level of 12.05 million units in 2012 since 1995, indicating a year-over-year decline of 8.2% due to the sagging demand for cars, as highly indebted banks were reluctant to finance new car purchases for customers. The decline was the steepest in the highly troubled Eurozone, where car sales dipped 11.3% to roughly 9 million units, according to Reuters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Most of the major automakers in Europe are resorting to job cuts and plant closures, as it became no longer feasible for them to undertake full-fledged operations in the continent. Unemployment in the EU reached 26.5 million in Mar 2013, while the unemployment rate increased to 10.9% in the same month from 10.3% in Mar 2012. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the U.S. automakers, Ford plans to shut vehicle and component plants in the U.K. and Belgium in the next two years while General Motors would suspend car production at its Bochum plant in Germany -- which employs 3,100 workers -- in 2016. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
