Please take a stand and discuss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India is one of the most populated countries in the world. Our economy is considered to be developing. Is this population an hindrance to our growth? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As everything has its pros and cons, so does population of more than one billion. Ofcourse, we have more mouths to feed than we have hands to cook. However, being an optimist, I would like to look at it as a sea of opportunities. Lesser hands to cook doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we don&amp;#39;t have resources. The issue here is that the resources are not properly distributed. The economy is quiet unbalanced. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This unequal distribution of resources does not provide equal opportunities to all. Also, lack of education bars people to look out for the opportunities. Because of the lack of awareness and guidance, people are not aware of&amp;nbsp;what the country has for them. Most of the time, there is no quest of coming out of the niche and explore the outer world which is full of chances. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Have we thought about this topic a decade ago, then this would have souded like a politician&amp;#39;s pre poll speech. If we look at the market now, we can see that it is attracting foriegn investors. Because of the labour cost, which is much lower than the European or American market, Indian market is the centre of attraction to the world. BPOs, KPOs and similar ventures offer bread and butter to&amp;nbsp;millions of youngsters. Other countries invest in our market because of the economical market and availability of labor and resources.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Besides this, there are new concepts in the markets for enterpreuners.&amp;nbsp;Ten years ago, who could have thought of online shopping portals, advising people how&amp;nbsp;and where to invest money, theme&amp;nbsp;weddings&amp;nbsp;or offering lucrative deals to people as business ideas. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Not only our country, even other nations of the world are offering good jobs to our citizens. Be it China, Europe, United States or Gulf, Indians are everywhere, doing&amp;nbsp;every kind of job.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I agree that as the opportunities are increasing, so does the population. We need to maintain a balance here. This is possible by educating people, making them aware of the opprtunities, providing vocational training, special plans from the government to support small scale business ideas, reaching out to people and listening to their issues.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Having said this, I would like to add that even though there are enough opportunities for the capable people, Government needs to take steps to control population and open up the right doors for everyone in the country. FDI seems one such step.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
