Income or defecit in each country affects the economic conditions globally. The developing and emerging countries are termed as &amp;#39;developing and emerging&amp;#39; as they are continually striving to develop themselves and to be at par with the developed countries. They are doing so by raising their exports and imports and thereby indulging in Foreign trade. Such trades are no doubt increasing the flow of currencies across the globe, but the overall economic condition is in jeopardy. Developing countries should try to make the best utilization of the inhouse resources than depend on external sources/exports and remain in debts. Making the maximum utilization of the resources available in the respective countries will control global issues like unemployement, inflation and global defecit. Every developing and emerging country should not neglect the natural sources of land, coal, oil and other such commodities that are available in their respective country. Exporting such goods is advisable only after the needs of the country are met. If every individual and every nation contribute to the best of their ability without any intention of fraud and selfishness, the global economic condition will be stable and worthwhile for the generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
