<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/27/2015 5:09:20 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In the modern day scenario, with the increase in advancement of technology the globe&amp;nbsp;has become an "ELECTRONIC BALL", meaning we are surrounded with technology and its tools so much so that we cannot think even a day spent without use of tech-based gadgets. The first technology based gadget/product to emerge as most popular one were the "COMPUTERS". Computers have said to be the beginners for the Electronic Era. Charles Babbage was the person to invent the computers which were initially used to compute basic calculations , storing of data but now with 4 generations of computers passing by their functionallity is not only limited to basic fucntions which existed earlier but it has gone much beyond the existence of human mind. Due to this they have now become one of the important part or even we can term is as a basic need of big comapnies, offices, departmental stores or even the households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers when they were &amp;nbsp;invented decades were of very large size, approximately they would occupy the whole room and also they were very costly, but now as we see the size and price of the computers have drastically decreased so much so that even in rural areas people have begun to make use of computers. The modern day form of computers include personal computers, laptops, notebooks, tablets etc. They are used not only by professionals or employed people but even by school going kids too. The concept of e-teaching has made the lives of children more tech-friendly and also mad them more prone to make use of computers or laptops even for doing projects of small topics or making notes. Computers are used in almost all fields , right from the big billion dollar companies to the small medical stores or even the departmental stores, even the minute work of biiling a 10 rupee product to carrying out transactions of billions of dollars is done with use of computers, they are also used to large amounts of information whether confidential or general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive side the evolvment of computers have made the lives of people very easier as they are able to search, store,retrieve and revert any data or information very quickly and safely, also it has led to reduction in manual work which is slower and also inaccurate sometimes. This has proven to be a cost effective step for big organisations as the automation of their non core activities has led to saving lot of money and time rather than going for manual work and hiring of huge manpower, computers have also increased the concept of work from home which has been a boon for people who cannot give their total time for going to a job and who still want to do some kind of productive job. Due to computers the trend of online business or the"E-Business " as its popularly called has started which has created a major change in the lifestyle of people. Nowadays with &amp;nbsp;a click of mouse we are able to get what we want at a very reasonable price and within a short time, this has again helped in saving time of people and also the decrease in assymetric information that is more prevalent in the traditional methods as the internet facility on the computers help the people to gain sufficient information which is almost accurate very easily before they wish to purchase or sell anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, with the enhancement in technology and emergence of new gadgets in the market people have become too much dependent on them which has caused a major impact on their health. People these days have become more lazy and this has given rise to many serious health issues like obesity and sometimes due to the overusage of computers or tech-based gadgets it has even led to the neurological problems, sitting for longer hours on the computer makes the person more stressful and also it leads to backpain, headache, eye problems etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the conclusion, I feel that our total dependence on computers will not be benificial for the overall development as this would reduce the metabloic rate of a person and also would make the people disconnected to the actual world. But yes, definately they have also proven to be a great help in making our lives more simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:ChinaEconomicOutlookfo2013&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China- Economic Outlook for 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above article talks about the skeptical speculations of the rate at which the economy of China will grow in the year 2013. After witnessing growth rate of 7.8 in 2012 which was considered to be the lowest in past 13 years there is a question mark on the growth of economy in the coming few years, surely it would`nt be a double digit rate for the year 2013. Some analysts speculated a growth range of 8-9 % but in the first quarter it witnessed only a 7.7% growth rate. Premier Li Keqiang estimates the average growth rate per year would go even lower than 7.0 which is considered to be more lower than the growth experienced in past 2 decades in his speech in Germany. He also said that China will experience entering into a &amp;nbsp;resonable growth range as China has become a more mature economy, Li `s expectations have become more modest towards the increase in growth of China`s economy as China is said to have a double GDP than its present in evry 10 years so a 7.0 growth is not at all considered to be bad for the country. To contribute to the healthy growth of the economy and &amp;nbsp;there has to be good investments in technology, increase or growth in industrialization and urbanization and also make improvements in agricultural productivity which would lead to market reforms, Li suggested. He also added that it would`nt be an easy task as China is regarded to be one of the biggest economies in the world. There is uncertainity on the happenings of such reforms as they need government approvals too which can be a vague process altogether. It may take sometime to implement the new regimes in order to witness the reforms and cannot happen within a single go as China also faces many risks such as large govenrment debts, levearge in banking system and weaker manfacturing activites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manfacturing capacity in China is decreasing due to their poor performance in export markets and also due to increase in wage rate of people being employed. This increase of wages has also made an adverse impact on the competativeness in the export markets. This uncertainity has made the possibilty of even a 7-8 % grwoth very low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China`s global integration i.e., there relations with other countries also contribute to the uncertatinity in their economic development. The government in order to attract FDI`s and make a positive move for the economic growth plans to enter into the Trans-Pacific Pact(TPP) which consists of 12 countries including bigger players like US, Japan etc to establish free trade area in the pacific basin too. If it succeds in joining the TPP then it would collectively account for 50% of the global GDP. Also it would make it cheaper to trade with those countries as there would be removal or reduction of certain barriers like tariffs, quotas which are an important factor to be considerd while doing the cross border trade. This grouping would also free up the domestic markets to freely compete in the global scenario, which inturn would lead in increase of private sector industries or companies to develop as ther would be free movement of prices as well as credit. However this agreement has still a long way to come into practice and change the current scenario of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China &amp;ndash; Economic Outlook for 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fast can China grow? That is the question underlying much of the discussion about China&amp;rsquo;s economy these days. Clearly, double digit growth is not in the cards and may even be a thing of the past. Growth of 7.7 percent in the first quarter was considered disappointing, and, until recently, many analysts were expecting growth to revert to the range of 8&amp;ndash;9 percent. Yet now the government appears determined to reset expectations. The government has forecast that growth this year will be 7.5 percent, a good deal lower than many private analysts had forecast only recently. That is certainly slower than the 7.8 percent growth in 2012, which was the slowest rate of growth in 13 years. Premier Li Keqiang, in a recent speech in Germany, said that growth for the remainder of the decade will average an even lower 7.0 percent per year. Although far slower than the growth experienced during the past two decades, Li indicated that China is &amp;ldquo;entering a range of reasonable growth.&amp;rdquo; Given that China has become a more mature economy with a declining labor force, Li is probably correct in setting more modest expectations. Moreover, growth of 7.0 percent is not bad: It doubles the GDP in 10 years. Li said that a combination of industrialization, urbanization, improvements in agricultural productivity, and investments in technology can contribute to healthy growth, and that this requires more market-oriented reforms. He also said that &amp;ldquo;for a very big economy, this is not easy.&amp;rdquo; When and how such reforms will be implemented remains uncertain. While some reforms have been announced, many government statements have been relatively vague. With a new regime just installed, it could take some time to build the support necessary to implement much needed reforms. In the interim, China faces some risks, including the ramifications of large local government debt, considerable leverage in the shadow banking system, and weaker-than expected manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing weakness stems from weakness in export markets. In addition, rising wages in China are having an adverse impact on export competitiveness, thereby leading to an exodus of manufacturing capacity. Thus, even growth in the range of 7&amp;ndash;8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further global integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves China&amp;rsquo;s economic relationship with the rest of the world. China&amp;rsquo;s government now says it will study the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP), an effort to create a free-trade area in the Pacific Basin. Currently there are 12 countries involved in this effort: the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. If China joins the group, the TPP will collectively account for more than half of global GDP. Freer trade would entail not simply lowering tariffs and quotas, although this would be an important component. It would also involve freeing up domestic markets so that they would have to compete freely with foreign companies. From China&amp;rsquo;s perspective, this could be a positive development in that it would create pressure to privatize state-run companies, create a level playing field for the private sector, and allow free movement of prices of goods and credit. Still, agreement on the TPP is probably a long way off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
