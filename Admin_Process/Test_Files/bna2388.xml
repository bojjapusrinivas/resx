&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Introduction;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Infrastructure facilitiese in developing countries like india is growing rapidly to meet the requirements of &amp;nbsp;current dynamic business environment.A country can become global leader when it has great resources &amp;nbsp;and optimum utilisation of them.Now a days people ,especially in metro cities are treating time equals to money.Proper utilisation of time enhences the future prospects of the person ,organisation ,country and the world.Gone are the days ,where it takes atlest two hours to travel 30 kilometers on indian roads and trains.It has been observed from past 20 yers that,a greater change is brought in the feild of transportation.An efficient transportation network brings business friendly environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In the year 1853,pre indipendence british goverment developed first train route from mumbai to thane at a stretch of 30 kilometers.Post indipendence significant impovements taken place in indian railways like introducing express,super fast trains and providing air condioned coaches etc.Indian railways is one of the largest railway system in asia,appoximately 50,000 lakh people are working under indian railways.In metro cities like hyderabadh ,mumbai ,delhi metro trains are running to cater the needs of urbun population .In countrise like japan bullet trains are running whose speed ranging from 300 to 360 km/h.when we come to india we are having only superfast trais whose speed ranging from 80 to 140 km/h.yes it is agreed that indin railwyas is one of the largest and greater empoloyment generation in indian economy but when it comes to comparison from various developed countries and theire prospects the efficiency of the systerm needs to be improved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;India has better trains when we observe the facilities like online services which includes tiket booking ,cancilation, food ordering,know your train location ,tatkal bookings &amp;nbsp;and air conditioned trains and better toilets,coach cleaners,track maintanence etc.Accidents has decreased drastically over the years and providing insurence for passengers etc. But to boost the indian economy india requires BULLET TRAINS which brings efficiency in the system and enhences indias growth prospects. according to economic experts ,in future by the year 2030 indian infrastructure will be like singapore having bullet trains ,sky ways,manufacturing hubs etc.Deceasing the time of travel brings greater utilisation of human resources.To meet the requirements of growing population and to build the &amp;nbsp;connection between the citese through shortest routes india requires bullet trains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Government of india needs to cosider this issue seriously as our peer countriese are moving ahead than us.It is possible in india to introduce bullet trains with the availability of technology and going for PPP(Public private partnership).The best example is hyderabadh metro .The speciality of hyderabadh metro rail is single piller construction.yes ,entire track of 72 kilometers is on single pillers where it is no where seen in asia. As globally growth rate is staggered for developed countries ,world is looking on india ,where greater scope for development in various sectors and availability of young generation and resuorces. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; CONCLUSION;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;BULLET TRAIN is not just a source of traveling it represents the stability of the country .It incurs huge cost and capital but its fruits are defenetly brings laurals.when we compare the advantages and disadvantages of bullet trains ,advantages has upperhand.To show us whon we are and what potential we had ,india defenetly needs bullet trains for fast growth and to create &amp;nbsp;business viable environment. &amp;nbsp;Indirectly to utilise available resources in india effectively bullet trains can contribute to the countries GDP.So,i suggest that BULLET TRAINS &amp;nbsp;is need &amp;nbsp;of the hour as we all ready having BEST TRAINS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
