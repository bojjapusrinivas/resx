Please elaborate if it is necessary to commercialize the medical services or we are better off without it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Medical care &amp;nbsp;is a basic necessity of citizens &amp;nbsp;as it is concerned about their well being and humanity , as we know in many of the poor villages there are no proper hospitals and as of now 104 services are handling those situations . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;According to me all the necessary services to be commercialized as they are to be paid as thirde party , so that there will be a &amp;nbsp;lot of change in the situations , now we see 108 and 104 services which go all over the state doesnot have proper eqvipment and takes long time for reaching the victim place , where as other private hoispital services doesnot take much time in reaching . They provide customer sentric services , in such conditions all the services to be commercialized and maintained proper rules and regulations ,such that they can help the patients in time .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;proper infrastructure and rules to be maintained in traffic policies ,as there is any ambulance on way space need to be provided by the other co passesngers and in signals they are not to be waited , these are some changes to be maintained by the government and taken care for the well being of patients and should maintain suctomer sentric policies .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;in this modern societies people got influnced got influnced by other cultures and they are moving towards the change . odd thing the world is facing is lack of humanity and they are afraid to call ambulance services ,if there is any emergency . There should be commercialised services like a proper emergency service to bve maintained by the government ,such that they take care of particular region of 3km and they keep on rotating the region for helping the people who are in need .l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;As this to be maintained government &amp;nbsp;cannot make many departments ,for that the services to be maintained and awards to be given for the good service for encouraging the employees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Care &amp;nbsp;also to be taken for the employess by providing world class safety measures and uniforms. These are some conditions which the service provider to be followed as much of the people are concerned about their well being and not to others as they are afraid of troubles which they are going to face by the department .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;There are many benifits which the people can get by commercializing the services are :&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;* Proper eqvipped services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;* Well trained doctors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;* Quick emergency services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;* Proper treatment to the patients in the service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;A proper planning to be done by the government ,so that flaws and drawbacks to be taken care when it is commercialized. Good reputation in the public also increses if they provide good services. I dont say we are not better , few things to be changed in the service and human resource management also to be maintained with the employees for making them work with satisfaction. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;By modernizing the services we can help the people who are ill without any support taken by others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
