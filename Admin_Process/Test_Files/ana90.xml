<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;12/14/2012 2:33:51 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than one billion Indians: Is this a problem or a sea of opportunities? Please take a stand and discuss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I would not define this as a probelem , as mother earth neeeds to take care each of the indiviusuals born in India . However the probelem lies in utilization of the Man power vested with our country . Hence to explore these oppurtunities a certain number of steps need to be taken .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The reposnisblity lies with &amp;quot;we the people&amp;quot; as a democracy should take those small steps&amp;nbsp;which which will eridicate the unrighteous from their places . &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Thus the questions arises arises how can this be implored , well firstly and foremostly we need to stop playng the&amp;nbsp;Blame Game and function as a team together . I am talking in refrence of the indian Goverment&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp; the parliment does not function for a week and&amp;nbsp;no one is bothered&amp;nbsp; and the indian public is glued to television screens due to cheap thrills .Thus I beleive we forgetten our prinicple for &amp;quot;unity in integrity &amp;quot;. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In todays age the one with money is considered&amp;nbsp; to be the most powerful and&amp;nbsp;this is how corruption diggers in our country . &amp;nbsp;I beleive we can not attribute this to&amp;nbsp;a over growing population . Today even an auto wala knows the procedure to mint money&amp;nbsp; because he has&amp;nbsp;lacks options as he has to bread and butter for his family . I would not say the the goverment is not doing their duty to fulfil his needs and wishes it is just that somoene in the ladder is stealing not by their ablities however by bribery&amp;nbsp;. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This is one of the main reasons our country is still lacking behind the farly developed countries like United Kingdom where the indivisual may be a bus driver&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; given equal oppurtunity and there is no drift between the rich and the poor . &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This entire discussion of a paragraph unknowingly&amp;nbsp;reflects exactly&amp;nbsp;what the statistics in our country have to&amp;nbsp;say , that there are vast economic inequalities in our country . The required measures for this&amp;nbsp;deep probelem &amp;nbsp;need to be taken before&amp;nbsp;the situation worsens&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;let alone somone misuses our innocence. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Thus we as indivisuals have to rise up and make our mark in society .&amp;nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
