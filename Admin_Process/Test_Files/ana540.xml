What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Living in the big cities has many benefits that the rural areas. Big cities have big markets, lots of job opportunities, have many institutes to study as compare to the rural areas. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;A student living in the big has more opportunity to study high and get the good job, but a student living in rural area has no&amp;nbsp;option to take admission in good institute. He/she&amp;nbsp;has come to big city to study. He/she waste too much time in travelling or has to live in the hostel. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;A person get the job in big city than he/she can travel in his own city by his own vehicle or by the the public transport. but if the person living in the rural area there is not much chances they get the job. Rural area person come out of the house to get the job and earn.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In terms of markets, big cities have big markets, all branded shops are available the cities, big malls, big showrooms where a person get everything under the one roof. No person need to roam here and there. In rural areas there are no such type of markets. They have shops, small shops for the single item. Person roam to the whole market to get the different&amp;nbsp;items.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If we are talk about the playing areas and the grounds, then big cities are better beacuse big cities have play grounds that are small as compare to the the rural areas but they are clean. Proper platforms are there to walk, to play to excercise and any thing. In rural areas, we have grounds and palying areas both. They have very big open area but the main disparity is they are messy and dirty. No body take care of them. Children in rural areas play in dusty evironment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Transportation is also one of the big issue in the rural and big cities. Big cities have good transportation facility but in rural areas transpotation facility is very low. Reason is the Roads. Roads in rural area is like a KACCHA RASTA. No proper way to travel. Most of the people like to travel on foot. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Now a days very major problem comes in the light that is the light and water cricies. In&amp;nbsp;big cities government ensures to families that they will provide the electricity and water&amp;nbsp;24 hours. but&amp;nbsp;in rural people live in dark for about 10-12 hrous in a day. They go to the&amp;nbsp;miles away from his home to get water.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government has to take the good step for the people living the rural areas to make they develop. Rural area has space to live and greenary to breath. Government has to utilize that space and make the rural area a beautiful city. Build government offices in the rural areas so the people will get the job easily in his own areas. Construct managed market, make the planned play grounds where children can play.&amp;nbsp;Build new institutes with all facilites and new technology. If all these issues minimized then I think there will be no difference in the rural and big cities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
