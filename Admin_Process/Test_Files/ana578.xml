What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Big cities&amp;#39;s life style are very diffrent in comparison to reral areas. Environment of the big cities are very diffrent. In big cities peoples live in flats,&amp;nbsp;farm houses and&amp;nbsp;apartments where facilities&amp;nbsp;very diffrent in comparison to rural areas. In flats,&amp;nbsp;farm houses and apartments we can see morden things like A.C., Coolers, Tiles, luxaries cars like Honda citi cars, Safaries, BMWs, and lots of diffrent diffrent cars. Apart from them we can see Morden Kitchen and fully furnished rooms and bad rooms and kitchens. Theses things are very far from rural areas. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In rural areas there is just lots of raw houses are there and there is no proper facility of light supply and water supply. And no any options or resourses fo earning. There are depands only their fields but in cities peoples having lots of resourses of earning. If we talk about the multi cities then here&amp;#39;s environment are very helpful and in faver of peoples. Multi Cities provide lots of jobs in diffrent diffrent sectors like In Computer sector, Malls, Big Bazar. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Peoples can live here because here are lots of options that how they have to live and how they have to earn and how they have to save money here is posible. But in reral areas on options. rural peoples have only one option just hardwork with their fields. Rural Peoples are very hardworker.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If our indian govt. want and our leaders want then they can minimize this disparity.&amp;nbsp;They can change&amp;nbsp;rural areas into cities ares.&amp;nbsp;In our govt. lots of leaders are currepted and they have criminal records.&amp;nbsp;But they have approch and govt. power so court&amp;nbsp;and CBI Inquiry can not do&amp;nbsp;anything towards this crime and curreption.&amp;nbsp;If govt. department will be curreptless then rural areas can be dovloped as Cities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Every Year Indian govt. passed lots of bugget for the diffrent diffrent Sectors Improvements but&amp;nbsp;due to leader and govt. sarvants curreptions all Improvement plan got failed. Otherwise in rurals areas we can see small small industries and resoures of earning. With the help of these resourses rural areas can change in urban areas. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
