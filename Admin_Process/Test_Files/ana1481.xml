<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;6/26/2014 4:12:48 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is India&amp;#39;s expenditure on hi-tech areas justified from the social and economic point of view. Elaborate giving reasons.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India is like far behind in terms of hi-tech expenditure when compared to other countries in every field&amp;nbsp;like use of tech in areas such as &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;a)Predicting climate &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;b)Collection of&amp;nbsp;important data which is in national interest &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;c)Security at various public places such as railway stations, bus stops, public parks&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The things which are pointed above are the basic things were the&amp;nbsp;Indian government should concentrate in improving by heavily investing in tech, by doing so&amp;nbsp;they can&amp;nbsp;manage each and every&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="2"&gt;segment in&amp;nbsp; a proper way efficiently. Both from social and economical point investing in tech in these areas is important. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I feel that investment in tech can help a country to develop in a effective and sustained manner. The use of tech helps the government keep track of each and every area efficiently.&amp;nbsp;Their may be heavy investment but in the long run the investment pays off.&amp;nbsp;For a developing country like ours investment in tech is important.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India has the potential and has the money to invest in tech in areas which are very important. I feel their is a lack of interest on the part of the Indian government, as they think of it as a waste of public money and still be dependent on traditional methods.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;But&amp;nbsp;I feel that things are changing the government has realised that investment in tech is important. Investment in tech is growing but at a lower pace.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India is one of the biggest exporter of I.T services and India has the experts and can handle these things effectively. Government can also give important tech related projects to private firms in case they cannot handle things on their own, by this way they are creating employment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;So for a sustainable economic growth government should have an eye on every area, this can be done only by investing in tech.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
