What according to you are the key contributions of Education in Modern Society? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly... what you have said is &amp;nbsp;absolutely right because an education definately &amp;nbsp;has had positive &amp;nbsp;impact on the society. According to my view an education is became as basic need just like others food, water,shelter and cloth; to survive ones life in these days. Education enables the people &amp;nbsp;to become a good citizen, and help to develop the morality,intellectuality,intelligence and discipline. It is observed that most of the succesful personalities became successfulin their respective fields by pursuing an advanced studies like B.teh,M.B.A;M.C.A and Doctoral Programmes. over the past decade India has been growing tremoundously interms of education sector. but still India remains as undeveloped country. Ofcourse i am sure that India is emerging country but we have to make the India as developed country to stand at par with developed countries like U.S. Japan,etc. interms of education. Most of educational institutes doesn&amp;#39;t have qualified and talented faculties. India is producing 8 Lakhs graduates( inclusive of B.tech,M.B.A,M.C.A. and degree) in a year, but how many of them getting job after completion of their courses only 20 per cent of aspirants are getting selected by govt organizations or private organizations rest of them remains as jobless.this is how our indian &amp;nbsp;institutes are imparting the studies to the students.ofcourse there is no doubt we have developed a lot compare to last decade. we had attracted many M.N.C&amp;#39;s to openup their branches in our country. Finally what i wanted to say is the Indian education can only survive when it enhances employability among the passing out students.Every student has to develope &amp;quot;INDUSTRY READY SKIILS&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
