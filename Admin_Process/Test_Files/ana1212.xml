What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In India we find really a great gap for healthcare supply to the demand .In early days there were no hospitals at all, but as we are trying to develop our country, we find much of the change in this&amp;nbsp;sector.we find the major&amp;nbsp;role of the government for this change.Healthcare is the sector were we need&amp;nbsp;Innovation, Adaptability towards new technology,Learning thirst.The government plays a vital role for&amp;nbsp;most of the&amp;nbsp;development&amp;nbsp;of many sectors but healthcare is the only sector were we also&amp;nbsp;find private sectors involvement for the development&amp;nbsp;.India as a developing country must mainly concentrate on Healthcare sector as we all know &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;quot;HEALTH IS WEALTH&amp;quot; -A healthy person can always lead a wealthy life.This would definately add to nations wealth too.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The measures are taken for improving the patient care ,but we&amp;nbsp;only see some success in it.Other countries mainly follow the strategies to improve the health of there people.Many of the countries follow to provide health insurances for&amp;nbsp;their people,this help them to utilise the benefit of&amp;nbsp;it and inturn acquire&amp;nbsp;a good health out of it.Generally the patients entring the hospital are&amp;nbsp;in a dilema whether they will be cured or not .The healthcare is all about making patients comfortable towards treatment and making them fit and fine.&amp;nbsp;This role is played by the staff members at the hospitals and the most important person ,that is a &amp;#39;DOCTOR&amp;#39;.Though a doctor is so important for patients care the supporting staff also plays a vital role.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Every person may&amp;nbsp;face any kind of&amp;nbsp;issue towards their health&amp;nbsp;.They definately visit hospitals ,their they need the help of those staff members.This is the only service sector ,where you can&amp;#39;t expect returns on your investments,it is all about rendering services for the sake of humanity.In India we are lacking with that Humanity,Kindness which is the basic essential for the sector.The indian healthcare sectors render services on the basis of money earning,economic growth.This attitude should be changed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Government if takes the measures such as good infrastructure,good sum of amount for the work,then it is possible to see the change in attitude.Government should take measures for ensuring the behaviour of the staff as well as doctors.This is only possible through the seminars of personality development.The supporting staff such as nurses should be given a prior preferance&amp;nbsp;for their personal development.Government&amp;nbsp;should encourage the youngsters to participate&amp;nbsp;in playing role for healthcare sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The students can be encouraged by the&amp;nbsp;opportunities offered.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The healthcare sector can be devolped by providing the people the information regarding the &amp;nbsp;importance of health and the requirement for taking care of it.It would also encourage people to do so if the healthcare sectors show how they take care of patients.The treatment which is given, the patience with which they listen to patients complain,the infrastructure providing a neat and clean environment.&amp;nbsp;Government can take some help of law to admire&amp;nbsp;as well&amp;nbsp;penalise regarding the staff related to patients care.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is not only the government who should take&amp;nbsp;measures&amp;nbsp;,but it is also the responsibility&amp;nbsp;of the citizens to&amp;nbsp;follow it. It is much more important for take precautions for the patients care than feeling bad at the later stage.As it is truely said &amp;quot;PRECAUTION IS BETTER THAN CURE&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
