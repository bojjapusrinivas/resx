<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5/30/2014 4:27:34 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the demand for foreign brands overtaken that for our home grown brands? How do Indian brands fare internationally in the era of globalization?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For every business, there must be some specific time period to be grown and to be ruin. At present,&amp;nbsp;there is a great scope for international&amp;nbsp;brands not only in India&amp;nbsp;but also&amp;nbsp;in Foreign countries. Now a days, products are being sold with the recognition of brand and&amp;nbsp;many times by brand ambassadors. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Especially in India, Product value has been improving if the specific brand has an attractive brand ambassador to be working with like filmy stars.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Even though the price of a product may high, the common consumer thinks that a product should have a great quality rather than quantity and appearance. So that, most upcoming firms of foreign brands are focusing on understanding the need of the consumer and his behavior towards a brand. Everyday a new brand is coming to attract people. Brand value is being developed with promotional activities in the business. As we know that there is a huge selling of smart phones now. International brands seem as they are the best one to buy many times because we choose neighbor&amp;#39;s dishes tastier than our home food.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With the improvement of globalization, we can know what is happening around us and we are able to communicate with anyone in&amp;nbsp;minutes of time. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Consumer awareness has grown very effectively. &amp;nbsp;A dramatic change has been undergoing in the world day-by-day. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; However, there is a need to change in&amp;nbsp;Indian brands. Foreign&amp;nbsp;companies are able to forecast the future generation&amp;#39;s knowledge and ability. They will manufacture whatever the customer is willing to buy before he chooses to buy a brand. There should be a minimum analysis about the foreign brand. Indian brands are not cheap in the market according to its price but why in the quality&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;?. The answer is that we do not have much investment, manufacturing, and technical skills. Chinese produce more than&amp;nbsp;India and they sell their products&amp;nbsp;at low level of prices.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Indian brands are best if we compare them with tradition and formal. Indian firms follow&amp;nbsp;specific rules that include many values. Home grown brands are being best sold by the foreigners as we prefer foreign brands. Even though there is a huge difference in the demand&amp;nbsp;between the foreign and Indian brands, collectively we can assume that it is the time to reach and cross the foreign brands image very soon. Unless or until Indian&amp;nbsp;firms focus on productivity and innovation, it is not even possible to fly as the foreign brands to every country that we associate with. But we should hope for the best.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
