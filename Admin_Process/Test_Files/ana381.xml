Please elaborate with reasons and examples.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INDIA is a land of agriculture. Historically it had been contributing more to the GDP but slowly after the&amp;nbsp;opening of economy&amp;nbsp;in 1991 its the service sector that has come to the forefont. More MNC comming to INDIA and helping our economy to acheive&amp;nbsp;good growth rate is acceptable but one should not forget the agriculture sector and its importance.We have seen in the past that how global slowdown directly affects the service sector.SUBPRIME CRISIS,EURO CRISIS etc are some example and its aftermath had been disastrous for the whole world.Well,INDIA was not hit so badly becuase of proper policy framework that we follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent policy of allowing FDI in retail will not only help reviving our economy but agriculture as well.Farmers will&amp;nbsp;be at a great advantage&amp;nbsp;because of this as there will be no middle men between the farmer and the company.New technologies comming in will help them to increase their land productivity which will directly affect the output.WALLMART came to INDIA and started its operations with BHARTI,now because of the joint venture and new technologies it has helped a village in PUNJAB to grow tremoundously.Earlier the village land was not very productive and it couldnot yeild good crops but now the whole scenario has changed and withnin a year it had recorded to produce huge quantity of POTATOES.Also because of the lack of storage houses huge quantity of the crop had been going waste, but this all will be addressed once the big retail giants starts comming to INDIA. Also the government needs to come-up with policy&amp;#39;s which will help the farmers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INDIA as a country cannot neglect the service sector nor the agriculture sector because we are a developing nation so service sector plays a huge role in uplifting a country&amp;#39;s economic condition but on the other hand we should not forget the agriculture sector also. So a proper blend of both is the need of the hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
