What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is true to some extent that big cities offer benefits in comparision to rural ares but cannot say that it is purely correct and it&amp;#39;s not so that only big cities provides/offers benefits in comparision of rural areas.As despite giving a better lifestyle it also includes various hardcore steps to live on life peacefully and happily.As in big cities everyone keeps on track to become more and more powerfull and wealthier then anyone else,whereas in rural areas people are not of such mentality they spend time with thier loved ones they have humanity in their heart . Due to urbanisation lot of people from rural areas moved to urban areas where they found new occupations and forgot the life of rural areas .Now a days due to increament in life standard of people in cities they don&amp;#39;t have time to spend with their families as well as their children or dear ones.If we talk about minimizing the disparity among rural and urban areas then it can be said that now a days there is no difference in life of rural and cities life style as the life style of urban areas too had been changed due to faster increase in urbanisation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We can find and enjoy all type of facilities of cities in villages/rural areas too as electricity ,proper connectivity through transports,proper communication devices has been introduced to these rural areas .The increasing facilities in rural areas has lowered the difference of urban/cities or rural/villages.If we talk about education many schools that too english medium affiliated to C.B.S.E has been setup in villages for providing education to children of rural areas.Different new techniques has been introduced and being facilitated to farmers fo there occupation of farming so that the mannual hardship can be decreased from man .The women power has been same in rural as well as urban areas as if in cities women do jobs or business same in villages women control all house chores and as well as field work is also done or performed by them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In big cities we can only enjoy the kiti parties and birthday parties within a group of socities of working women or children whereas in villages we enjoy and entertain each and every festival &amp;quot;Teej-tayohar&amp;quot; with whole society without any hard bond with anybody .Both cities and villages have there own benefites and minus points as if in cities we can enjoy different new and upcoming&amp;nbsp;gadgets or techniques we cann&amp;#39;t enjoy fresh area or peaceful environment whereas in villages we find peaceful environment and with freshness in air too.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As per the heading does cities provide more benefities than rural areas we can some where agree to this point in manner if we are all talking about different new jobs in different sectors like IT,BANKING,FINANCIAL etc. here a cadidate having 10th pass certificate can also earn alot in B.P.O&amp;#39;s or K.P.O&amp;#39;s and anyone who are more qualified have no limits to earn .In cities we have white collered and blue collered both types of jobs so that people can easily lead their life with a proper stantdard.Increasing cities is a best example of having/gaining the more and more opportunities within the feild a candidate is expert or know his/her job he can earn name and fame in that.On same hand if we talk about villages/rural areas if a person or student fails his/her exam they are bound to do all house chores and irrigation that is an initial and important part of living in villages.Villagers do also force or sticking to same child marriage they aren&amp;#39;t too much familliar to different worse effects to getting marrying their children early as they think it a wise and good culture.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Rural and urban areas are now not having much disparity but only thing that is creating difference within them is litracy ,mentality that is not too much developed in rural population and little bit lacking behind from cities in terms of new trends and upcoming things.Rural areas are not much lacking but are to some points cann&amp;#39;t beat cities in their trends,fashion,life styles etc.The loopholes between rural and cities is only the occupation difference as in rural areas the main or initial occupation of population is irrigation whereas in cities it is different sectoral jobs or services .We can say that if the primary occupation is&amp;nbsp; left by villagers then where from will whole population get feeding products for their hunger thus it cannot be left . And if talk about leaving the jobs in cities then will be never be the developed nation ever .Thus it is clear that both are necessary on part of population living there.Villages are now a days not so far from cities people/ upcoming generations residing in villages are also doing jobs and different occupation in cities due to best connectivity between cities via various roadways,railways,etc. routes of travelling.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We cann&amp;#39;t say that there are disparities in rural and cities/urban areas as seeing the scenario it is clear that almost all facilities that are vailable in cities or metros are some or where facilitiated to rural areas too.Inspite of eradicating disparity we have to think about deminising the worse point of mentality of population so as to get and gain more and more positive result in terms so as we can attain full development and our nation is stamped as Developed Nation as U.S .If we see the living of U.S Nation people they are also in both jobs and irrigation then also they are on top most.Why???&amp;nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Just&amp;nbsp;because of new techniques of irrigation introduced thus here also we have to introduce new terms and techniques to farmers so that they can earn much more amount from their hardwork and hence can contribute most for country&amp;#39;s growth which will increase GDP of our nation and hence there will be no disparity within the life style of urban and rural ares of India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Various Yojana&amp;#39;s have been introduced that are beneficial for rural areas but some or where these are been truned into scams or corruption that politicians have been scanned under for grasping more and of amount that has to be used in development of rural population .The cooruption is also a worse thing that we can blame for disparity within rural and urban areas of country.In India involvment of politicians in each and every C.S.R activity ruin the program and hence it had an end that is not fruitful to Nation and hence the role of corrupt politicians or beaurocrats has imbalanced the situation of life standard of both rural as well as urban areas .To eradicate the disparity from both we first of all have to decrease or eliminate the role of politician for such big programs or Yojana&amp;#39;s under which we have to give benefits to indian population not the politicians.All mid-days meal scheme ,shasharta abhiyan for education or eradicating illiteracy rate ,etc. are being for eradicating the difference within life stantdard and fulfilling the basic needs of Below Poverty line population so as to equal the level and no difference is left between rural and urban areas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Finally justifying the heading / topic we can conclude that there are benefities of both on there own place whether it is living in cities or living in rural areas .We can further work more on eradicating disparity among them by provding and intorducing various facilities and upcoming techniques in rural areas and making them more connected to urban areas as well as updated to the current things.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
