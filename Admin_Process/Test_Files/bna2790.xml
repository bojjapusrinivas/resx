Because it is completely change or damage the future environment also. Government also giving many ads or teaching the things in programmes to aware the people about the plastic bans. Plastic covers or bags is truely damage the animals health or our health also. It is completely polluted the freash air. Ban of plastic covers or bags is really affected in economy, because many peoples are working in factories to making the plastic bags. But health is more important than money. So we should really stoped the making of plastic bags. Government also taking some serious actions to ban the plastic things. And we should teach the people to bring the other bags like jute, cloth or etc when going for shopping or vegetable market. This is really helpful to the environment for polluted the air. As a parents we should teach our children or in schools also conducting nice programmes to aware the use of or harm of plastic bags. This is good step or good start to move forward to our country to competiate the other countries, those who are completely stop the use of plastic bags.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The usage of smartphones reduce the market of small tablets or small phones, because of screen sizes varies. Using the any phones normally for phone calls, voice calls, messgaing, taking phones etc and not depends on screens. Now a days smartphones become more popular than small phones, because its screen sizes and providing the more features than small phones. Small children also using the phones or tablets without any knowledge. Usage of smartphones depends on person to person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle class people can use the smartphones for listening the songs or for phone calls, they dont know the other features of smartphone. But upper middle class people can have the good knowledge about the phones and they can buy the phones depends about the screen sizes and features provding by the phones. That`s why keep on growing the sales of smartphones year-by-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educated people can only buying the smartphones or giving the small tablest to their children for watching the rymes, taking the good things by watching the phones. Housewifes, students, employees also watching the smartphones based on their time management, screen sizes and mainly on their money budget. Demand of the larger phones is bigger than small phones, because of the phone screen sizes. Small tablets are mainly use for small kids, in journies etc.There are many tasks performed equally either in small or big screen phones and only depends on the facility provided by the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handsets played a rival role in any phones for journies, listening music or songs, watching movies, reading the news, sending or receiving the mails without distubing the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Title: Tablets vs Phablets: Strong Sales of Large Phones Will Cut into Demand for Small Tablets&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Growing interest in phones with screens over 5 inches is going to reduce sales of small tablets. It won&amp;rsquo;t noticeably cut into the market for larger tablets, however.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In recent years, the size of phone screens has grown dramatically. The average smartphone display measured 2.6 inches in 2007, and is now 4.9 inches. Partially driving this has been a steady decrease in the time spent making voice calls &amp;ndash; a typical person spent 720 minutes a month talking on a cell phone in 2011, but 673 in 2013. As people come to use these devices as portable computers more than simple mobile phones, larger screens have become more valuable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;This trend has reached the point that handsets large enough to rival tablets made up about 40% of the global smartphone market in the first quarter of 2014.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Small tablets are typically sold to people who want a light-duty computer with a display that&amp;rsquo;s larger than the one on their phone but is more portable than a laptop. The growing numbers of people who get a phone with a screen over 5 inches in size will see little need for a device with a screen that&amp;rsquo;s barely any bigger than their phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;For example, the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch display that will inevitably reduce demand for the iPad mini which has 7.9-inch screen because their functionality overlaps. If you&amp;rsquo;re just checking email and social networks, what would be the point in buying both?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Demand Has Changed, Not Stopped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Increasing interest in larger phones won&amp;rsquo;t kill off all demand for small tablets. After all, many people won&amp;rsquo;t want to carry a phablet and will still see a need for a larger tablet at home or office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Families may also keep small tablets from dying out completely. Many parents buy small, inexpensive tablets without service plans for their children. Parents are also more willing to give a sub-$200 tablet to a child than a phone, many of which cost over $500 to replace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;No matter what happens to small tablets, many market watchers do not expect demand for full-size models like the iPad Air to be affected by growing sales of phablets. IDC &amp;ldquo;expects more consumers to shift back toward larger-sized tablets with their next purchase.&amp;rdquo; Meanwhile, the Motley Fool wrote that the release of the iPhone 6 Plus &amp;ldquo;could ultimately drive mix up from the lower-cost iPad mini models and toward the full-sized iPads.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;While there are some tasks that can be performed equally as well on a 5- to 6-inch screen as on a 9- to 13-inch one, there are many others that require more real estate. As examples, while someone could use a 5.7-inch Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or a 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab 4 to order a pizza or Google an actress&amp;rsquo; filmography and have the same experience, but the full-size tablet offers significantly better functionality for watching a movie or writing a report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The line that people have drawn between phones and tablets is blurring, and maybe even fading. While screen size certainly varies over a wide range, both types of devices are small, slate-shaped computers without physical keyboards. One of the few remaining differences is that one type can make phone calls and the other can&amp;rsquo;t, but with FaceTime and Google Hangouts, does that really matter these days?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
