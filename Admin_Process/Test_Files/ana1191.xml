What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Introduction:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now-a-days India is developing country where is a healthcare economy of supply and demand in many other countries too. As per the medical industry must provide facilities of &amp;nbsp;healthcare to all the hospital for poor patient. healthcare is must&amp;nbsp; in all the firms where an emergency can fall by patients. The health care have to provide every cabinets of members in the hospitals. It should see all the major problems of low caste people and provide free campus of healthcare. As some of the people can help by donating bloods or donations for such poor people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As a human beings we must help poor people in their conditions and supply them some donations to safe there life. The government must provide cabs like medicals buses, emergency bus, etc.. and seems that every patient&amp;#39;s care is taken by doctors. But some of hospital need to fill the forms of patients or there need to pay all amount of&amp;nbsp; operations, surgery, etc.. This must not be done because&amp;nbsp;45% of the population are very poor and low caste were their can&amp;#39;t effort enough of there health problems. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;IMPROVEMENT ON PATIENTS CARE:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;1. The every patient&amp;nbsp; should be cared by the doctors and supply them medicine on time.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2. The hospital must be clean&amp;nbsp; surrounding where the cancer patients , heart patients, or handicaps could spread there diseases to other general people..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;3. As the patients are in critical conditions there must be observed first by the good qualified doctor where there can provide good medicine to patients..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There must see the healthcare budget in the organization where there can provide good facilities in there organization. Every organization must develop the healthcare department and social welfare to patients.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Finally, health hazard factors are needed to be assessed in uses of there agriculture which involves in every individuals intake of food. Government&amp;nbsp; must&amp;nbsp;implements which prevent the diseases from there care of it. Government should take proper medication to the poor people.&amp;nbsp;In emergency there must be&amp;nbsp; ambulance or travels for the poor people with their authorities to provide better improvement for &amp;nbsp;them. Government should provide counseling institution campus in such area where the poor people can go for regular checkups. As the government should take care of such areas like slum areas, or very short areas in India or any other countries too. The healthcare people must provide some placement to such authorities in other area to prevent with people who are in ill condition and seems to be in good well maintained areas around.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Government must provide healthcare for infants, adults, old people, for pregnant woman&amp;#39;s and so on. The population in India the another hazard healthcare should supply there authorities in every firms to develop the social welfares and budget to be in low price where the people can effort for there well condition. Healthcare should provide &amp;quot;clean and green environment&amp;quot; to prevent of diseases from one patient to other patients...The enormous gap between healthcare of supply and demand can be prevent by undertaking of well government and not doing such corruption in such industry. Where if its such happens there cant be a improvement in patients care in the country. we have to involve not to so such politics in healthcare organization. we need to prevent such corruption of money demanding in organization. Government must see important for people healthcare and should provide well food and&amp;nbsp; vitamins medicine&amp;nbsp;for patients care in the country.&amp;nbsp;so India can prove better towards improvements of every patients in a country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; THANK YOU&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
