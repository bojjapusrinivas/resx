<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:34:25 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I too agree there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply &amp;amp; demand because for the name sake funds are released for this sort of development by keeping various schemes&amp;nbsp;like &amp;quot;Aaroghya sree&amp;quot; free&amp;nbsp;treatment, but middle men like politicians are making to release those funds as policy makers of the Government provides data regarding the requirement&amp;nbsp;i.e., demand &amp;amp; supply &amp;amp; the&amp;nbsp;policy makers also say how much&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;cost incurred to supply to reach &amp;amp; satisfy the demand. what these currupted politicians do is for the name sake they passes those bills in the parlament &amp;amp; show offs there like they struggling for the sake of &amp;nbsp;people &amp;nbsp;development to make acceptance &amp;amp; clearance of the bill by higher command&amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp; they&amp;nbsp; finally achieves the acceptance &amp;amp; funds are released. But no ware you cannot find complete utilisation of those funds properly &amp;amp; completely.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;What I have found here in India&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;corruption is done not only at the level of the politicians, rich people but also at the level of contractors, smaller officials, even office boys.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government has one more scheme mobile education&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; provision of the products freely,&amp;nbsp;that is educating slum people,street people who are very poor&amp;nbsp; &amp;amp; who are not educated&amp;nbsp; &amp;amp; don&amp;#39;t know the minimum requirements of vitamins,good habits, who drinks dirty water which is not even boiled. So Government release some amount for recruiting&amp;nbsp; employees and make them facilitate with required charts &amp;amp; all the stuff which can be used to educate &amp;amp; improve awareness among those people regarding hygenic factors like food, clothing how it should be actually. Government also provides van&amp;#39;s to facilitate teacher&amp;#39;s for transportation to the slum area.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;But, what actually happens is teachers take the salary but they will go once in a while&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; spends less time there &amp;amp; all the stuff government provided are utilised by them personally. This is the main disadvantage in India there is no supervision from the officials they also involve in curruption they also not maintain the discipline.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This sort of behaviour is not only observed in Health care sector but also in every sector in India. We need to develop strict rules &amp;amp; laws ,at the same time we need to impliment those laws to improvise supply&amp;nbsp;to &amp;nbsp;meet the demand &amp;amp; reach&amp;nbsp; health related products to all the common man. There should be a proper transperency at each level; of supply to avoid the curruption. There should be a secret complaint box if any person was trying to manage &amp;amp; uses funds &amp;amp; products for there personnel needs then to facilitate &amp;nbsp;collegue&amp;nbsp;to complaine against the currupted one. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I also heard that what Government provides to the Govt. stores like free medicine, Injections are not supplied to the appropriate correct persons store people were selling it of to the private stores for cheaper rate &amp;amp; showing in there records they were showing the patients name as the most of ther patients are illiterates &amp;amp; poor people they unknowingly signs or keeps there thumb impression.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;What I heared about the &amp;quot;Rajeev Aroghya Sree Scheeme&amp;quot; is they were highlighting there scheme in the addsd &amp;amp; announcing&amp;nbsp; free treatment &amp;amp; medicines are supplied while elections, but at real time patients are finding difficulty when they approach hospitals both private &amp;amp; Government. At hospitals patients were shocked to here they will provide free treatment for only certain diseases only. Again they need to pay. All the vows Government made is only upto the elections only when poor people go for the sake of recommendations they ignore them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;What I personnally feel is is we all as the citizens of a Great country India we should supportively &amp;amp; collectively fight for the development of schemes &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;proper implimentation of those schemes by passing strict laws &amp;amp; rules.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We also need to educate people about those laws how to approach particular department &amp;amp; complain if store people wont supply what they demanded &amp;amp; the concerned persons should react quickly &amp;amp; solve those issues because it is a life &amp;amp; death problem as health issues cannot be ignored.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government should supply fish liver oil products like vitamin &amp;#39;A&amp;#39; &amp;amp; also when flue is there they need to supply masks, to protect themselves freely&amp;nbsp; not only for the suffurers but also to every persons surrounding them as a precautionary methos. But none of us where recieved them but they announced they were supplied to each &amp;amp; every person.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Actually Government releases the funds by partial amounts in that they middle men&amp;nbsp; like contractors will take some of the amount &amp;amp; store people will take some amount. In that way curruption is occuring at each stage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;What I heard is according to the population &amp;amp; the amount released by the government each poor people were getting only 1 rupee.&amp;nbsp;these currupted people were not living that 1 Rupee also. Not every people were deseased at a time so they are maintaining wrong records.If we do&amp;nbsp;survey &amp;amp; enquire the people who are listed in the record&amp;nbsp;that they have &amp;nbsp;taken the service will get shock&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; they will say nothing they recieved they didn&amp;#39;t even&amp;nbsp;visited hospital.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;I want to coclude we all should support &amp;amp; fight for the people &amp;amp; apply the petition to impliment strict rule &amp;amp; laws to avoid curruption &amp;amp; they we can fill the gap between supply &amp;amp; demand. At the schooling level only we need to educate all these laws.Then Supply &amp;amp; demand in health care can be meeted.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
