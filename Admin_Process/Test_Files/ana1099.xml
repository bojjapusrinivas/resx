What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Basically India is a developing country. Since it is a developing country there is an&amp;nbsp; enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand when we compare with the developed countries.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The following are the&amp;nbsp;reasons why the people in India are facing Health care&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;problems:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Since India is a developing country and consists of large population&amp;nbsp;and most of the population is below poverty line they don&amp;#39;t have proper food because of that&amp;nbsp; reason they fall under mal nutrition category.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The 70%&amp;nbsp;population below poverty line who are surviving in&amp;nbsp;india&amp;nbsp;are &amp;nbsp;having one&amp;nbsp; day meal.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Pvt.Medical services are very costly in the present situation which are not affordable by the poor and middle class people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Government medical services are not up to the mark.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;One of the major reason in India&amp;nbsp; is most of the population is uneducated ,unemployment and lack of information.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Since most of the population is from urban areas and are uneducated people they don&amp;#39;t have complete information about the health care supply units.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The unempolyment problem play a vital role along with the poverty.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There a high increse in the inflation rate.The people below the povery line and common man are not in a position to buy anything to survive.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Due to increase in the cost of goods the common man can&amp;#39;t puchase any thing for their family especially food which leads to the deficiency in the children and youth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;When we compare the health care facilities of a developed country with our country we are lagging in this sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The following are the major steps should be taken by the Government to improve patient care in the country:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The first and foremost step is to provide 100% free medical service to all people who are below poverty line.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The Government should implement new technolgy from the developed countries which helps to&amp;nbsp; save the life&amp;#39;s of many people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The Government should improve and encourage in Research and development (R&amp;amp;D)&amp;nbsp;especially in medical sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The Government should provide guidelines and services provided by them&amp;nbsp; especially to the urban and rural population by awareness programs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Since most of the population in India are uneducated.By using new technology like Television spread the awareness of health camps and services provided by the Government.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The Government should take care in not only providing the health services but also remedial steps should be explained&amp;nbsp; clearly to the patient.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The Government should provide free medicine&amp;#39;s required to the patient along with service&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The Government should provide 24/7 ambulance service.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The Government should pay attention towards the people who are below poverty line and take care of their food,education and medical care.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;when the proper education along with the food is provided to the children they will not fall ill, we will have healthy and happy Indian population.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
