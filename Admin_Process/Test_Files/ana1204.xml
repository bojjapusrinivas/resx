<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:34:39 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; India is a country with huge population and maximum percentage of the population is below the poverty line who cannot afford to the medical facilities which are costlier to their standards of living.The gap between the health care supply and demand exists due to the government&amp;#39;s inefficiency&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp; the major areas in which it has to focus and provide its assistance.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now a days government is coming up with new policies regarding health care to attract the people,but unfortunately they fail to succeed due to the lack of adequate resources and dedication towards the target.Firstly government should identify the areas which rate very low in the patient care,mostly rural areas in the country and try to provide them with required facilities.The area where the health care facilities are needed,should be constantly monitered by the senior officials, the local people should be informed about the facilities and they should be given the details of the facilities provided.The people who are reluctant to&amp;nbsp;make use of the facilities should be motivated to acquire them,by&amp;nbsp;training the members of thier community,by forming small gruops who constantly communicate with people in the community&amp;nbsp;to know what are thier problems&amp;nbsp;regarding health and giving them suggestions regarding the treatment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Currently undertaken projects of the governments are good ,but the crucial step that has to be taken are to implement them correctly.the beneficiaries of the facilities are not aware of the problems and are not able to&amp;nbsp;reap the benefits provided to them.Government should take strict actions&amp;nbsp;regarding the&amp;nbsp;corporate hospitals not&amp;nbsp;following the basic&amp;nbsp;rules and regulations.under the roof of&amp;nbsp;Aarogya sree many hospitals are reaping benefits of it by&amp;nbsp; treating the patients for money,especially people who are not aware about the facilities provided by the government.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Government should take steps to encourage&amp;nbsp;students from rural background to take up the studies&amp;nbsp;relating to the medical background and it should be made mandatory that they should serve their people rather than going to the cities to work in the corporate hospitals.To increase the supply to meet the demands more and more students should be motivated to take up this as the career and help the dedicated and talented students rather wasting the capital on the one who is not at all eligible.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The major step that has to be taken is to put the people into action who genuinely are dedicated toward&amp;#39;s their work and always try to encourage the young talent and try to take inputs from them.The gap can be reduced by&amp;nbsp; identifying the major areas where facilities are required and focussing on&amp;nbsp;them rather than providing to the one who have so many opportunities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
