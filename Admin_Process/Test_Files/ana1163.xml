<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:32:09 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;In&amp;nbsp;the present scenario the one of the major problem arising issue is not meeting the requirements of general public regarding health care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Though India has been advanced in many fields like use of technology, innovations and discovery, but still the government of India could not meet the demands completely in providing the effective treatment. I would like to &amp;nbsp;suggest that the government&amp;nbsp;should instruct or pass a&amp;nbsp;rule that every hospital whether government or private hospital&amp;nbsp;should gives its first priority to provide treatment to the suffering rather than asking for all the formalities to be completed.&amp;nbsp;compared to earlier, ambulance services are far better improved but as population in our country is enormously increasing much&amp;nbsp;faster availability of ambulance services where ever required&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;must be provided.&amp;nbsp;The government should adopt some of the advanced treatment methods that are successfully implemented, we can adopt this from the advanced countries.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; All the hospitals should be well equipped with the advanced&amp;nbsp;treatment technology so the service&amp;nbsp;is provided at&amp;nbsp; much faster rate and&amp;nbsp;its not too late to give treatment to the patient.The number of hospitals for treating even major health problems should be increased in rural areas also rather than just focusing on constructing in the urban areas. the people from rural areas face a major problem of traveling&amp;nbsp;to long distance, where some times due to lack of availability of hospitals near by,the person may loose his life.&amp;nbsp;There should be an&amp;nbsp;increase in services of mobile hospitality were at least an immediate first aid is given to the sufferer&amp;nbsp;at that point of time.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Its not only just the technology or availability of hospitals is important but efficient doctors are also equally important its into their hands that how efficiently&amp;nbsp; they can treat people. The pharm industry as achieved greater importance, it is advisable to the pharmacies to have a timely record for the demand of medicines to meet the requirements.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;finally I suggest that&amp;nbsp; the government should understand the need for growth of health care and its importance and the measures to provide efficient services should be implemented so that people have to not rush&amp;nbsp;from &amp;nbsp;home country to some other part of world&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;to get their disease cured.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
