<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2/1/2014 11:32:18 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As we all know how people are affected by many diseases which are spread around us.In earlier days, there were few hospitals with few surgeons and were located far away from residential areas. Many people faced problems in travelling to hospitals located at far places. In those days, we had only government hospitals which din&amp;#39;t have a &amp;nbsp;good ambience, facilities and&amp;nbsp; most important&amp;nbsp;&amp;#39;Technology&amp;#39;. People&amp;nbsp;expected best services from hospitals but as they weren&amp;#39;t much hospitals exsisting&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in those days , their expectation went in vein. Hospitals could not meet the demands of people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Coming to today&amp;#39;s Lifestyles and upgraded Technology in India, many organizations and hospitals have emerged for rendering services to people. Latest Technologies such as ECG scanning machine etc., have been integrated in many hospitals. Many hospitals provide various services to the in-patients and out-patience.Cheif Minister of Andhra Pradesh , Kiran Kumar Reddy has introduced a service like call 108 an ambulance is provided for the deceased.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Many people face problem with the fee that is to be paid at the counter bill. Many hospitals charge an huge amount on bill to the patient&amp;nbsp;; where a patient&amp;#39;s family fails to pay. Taking into consideration of household&amp;#39;s income and economy, hospitals have to charge affordable amount with taxes. Even in these days , we find few Government hospitals running. Most&amp;nbsp;of them&amp;nbsp;prefer going to government hospitals as they are cheap as compared to the private hospitals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Government must focus on providing best services to people by considering the following steps:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;1. Not billing an huge amount on patient&amp;#39;s.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2. Rendering 24X7 services.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;3. Hospitals being located in major areas where people have an easy access to hospitals.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;4. Using the upgraded technology and best equipments for treating patient&amp;#39;s.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;5. Most inportantly providing well educated and well qualified Doctor&amp;#39;s.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I hereby conclude that, by focusing on the above mentioned steps and rendering the best medical services to people ; Government increase countries economy . By providing the best services and curing people many foreigners also travel to India for their recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
