Please take a stand and discuss&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I strongly favour the point that More than one billion Indian :&amp;nbsp;Its not just a problem Its THE biggest problem which is stopping India from been the most powerful and developed nation of the world, even though the 1 billion mark may seem a blessing sometime because it represents the availabilty of a large workforce, but still controlling the crime rate is the major agenda of the day .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India has been overflowing with Human being ,&amp;nbsp;and with redefining the marriage age , people are getting far away from birth control, even today having a son is considered as a blessing .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Increasing population leds to increase in crime rate , rape , extoration , robbery , abduction .There are places where even though the family is only&amp;nbsp; getting&amp;nbsp; 1 meal but still they wont stop having kids , this had led to increase in slum population in the country . &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The government wants to achieve the rank of developed country&amp;nbsp; for that it has to put a birth control law in action , not going too far India can follow China , our next door neighbour , all that china achieved was through putting certain rules and regulations on its citizens, most primarily the birth control regulation, every family must have only 1 child.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;With growing population , living spaces are decreasing , and to accomodate the increasing population we are killing the natural resources , cutting down forests and constructing buildings , leading to calamities , many kids are not able to get education during their childhood but the people living in the nearby building do , which leads to hatred and resentment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;When a family is having large no of members to feed than they can afford , they indulge into robberies , extortion , abduction , etc to make easy money for the family, thereby increasing the crime rate of the country. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In newspapers or on news channels we hear daily about the increasing crime rate , and we wonder why the government is not doing anything about it , but have we ever thought for a single moment that sometimes its the responsibility of the society to make a country a better place to live in. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Recently a good measure has been taken by the government by distributing the birth control measures at the doorstep , and the activity will be performed by a doctor, who can further explain&amp;nbsp;about the benefits of bith control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There are only 2 things that are stopping India from being a developed nation first - population and second corruption,&amp;nbsp;thus India&amp;nbsp;should not be proud of this one billion mark , instead they should try to control it , by providing birth control education to not only rural part of India but Urban India too .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
