Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Computer:A computer is an electronic device which accepts data,process the data and gives desired output.It was introduced by Charles Babbage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer is machine which has several input and output devices.Input devices are those devices which are used to enter data like keyboard etc and Output devices are those which gives us the results like printer etc.&amp;nbsp;Now-a-days computer is has became an essential tool at various organisations like educational institutions,Government companies and other financial institution etc.Our dependence on computer has made the life very easy. It accept the information and gives the results accurately with out any errors where as man can make mistakes with the help of latest technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Yes our life are going to be more dependent on computer because of advances technology which ultimately help an individual to compete with various organisations with less efford. With the help of internet anyone can be &amp;nbsp;connected with what is going on around the world.Computer is very helpful as it work for 24 hrs without any tiredness where as an individual cannot work for all the day.Internet is a network of network which help to get information about various issues happening around the world.Advance technology is helpful to upadate the knowledge of not only employees but also it is useful for students,who are going to work in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Every concept has its own pros and cons.In the same way dependence on computer also have pros as well as cons. Coming to pros it is an electronoic machine which helps to transfer the data from one place to another with the help internet accurately within few minutes with the help of latest software.It makes an individual to complete his work on time.Dependence on computer technology also helps in the development of the country. Some of the effects of dependence on computer is the data which is transfered from one place to another may get hacked .The data can be used by some unauthorised persons which effect the content of the data,firewalls are helpful to protect the data from unauthorised persons, the data can also get vanished due to virus which can be returned by using antivirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence dependence on computer is good but over dependence on computer may leads some problems like leakage of important information etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Eurozone financial crisis is one of the crisis that has adversely affected the operations of many global automakers especially GM and Ford, who have a significant exposure to the market.Because of financial crisis there is a fall in sale of car.According to&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;European Automobile Manufacturers` Association (ACEA), car sales in Europe reached its lowest level of 12.05 million units in 2012&amp;nbsp;indicating a decline of 8.2%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;The decline was the steepest in the highly troubled Eurozone, where car sales dipped 11.3% to roughly 9 million units.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;Unemployment in EU is the major reason for the fall of car sales as unemplyment in EU reached 26.5 milliom in march 2013&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;while the unemployment rate increased to 10.9% from 10.3% in Mar 2012.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;U.S. Market Recovery &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Strong pent-up demand due to aging vehicles on the U.S. roads along with falling unemployment rate have been the key factors in driving the auto sales in the U.S. Average age of vehicles on U.S. roads increased to 11.3 years in January 2013 from 10.8 years in 2012. Banks were also friendlier as they offered greater access to loans with lower interest rates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% to the five-year high of 14.5 million vehicles in 2012. In May 2013, auto sales in the U.S. grew 8.2% to 1.44 million units while it rose 10.9% to 15.3 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted rate (SAAR) basis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Economic Crisis in Europe &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The present Eurozone financial crisis has adversely affected the operations of many global automakers, especially GM and Ford, who have a significant exposure to the market. Car sales in Europe continued to be low owing to weak consumer confidence on the back of a weak economy triggered by the crisis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;According to the European Automobile Manufacturers` Association (ACEA), car sales in Europe reached its lowest level of 12.05 million units in 2012 since 1995, indicating a year-over-year decline of 8.2% due to the sagging demand for cars, as highly indebted banks were reluctant to finance new car purchases for customers. The decline was the steepest in the highly troubled Eurozone, where car sales dipped 11.3% to roughly 9 million units, according to Reuters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Most of the major automakers in Europe are resorting to job cuts and plant closures, as it became no longer feasible for them to undertake full-fledged operations in the continent. Unemployment in the EU reached 26.5 million in Mar 2013, while the unemployment rate increased to 10.9% in the same month from 10.3% in Mar 2012. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the U.S. automakers, Ford plans to shut vehicle and component plants in the U.K. and Belgium in the next two years while General Motors would suspend car production at its Bochum plant in Germany -- which employs 3,100 workers -- in 2016. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Among the European automakers, Renault plans to retrench 7,500 jobs in France by 2016 while each of Fiat and Peugeot has decided to eliminate 1,500 jobs. Among the Japanese automakers, Honda announced plans to terminate 800 jobs at its South Marston plant near Swindon, southwest England in the second quarter of 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
