<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/25/2015 5:07:53 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic and infrastructural planning of an area should be done bearing in mind the environment conservation. To what extent do you agree with this statement? Provide reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Economic planning should be in such a way that it enhances its strengths and keep it strong enough to sustain any possible threats in the future. For that to happen sometimes there is a need to have less interest in environmental conservation. As the globe is running towards more capitalistic system and you are judged by how economically strong you are. A company which is economically weak can not save itself in times of crisis, let alone about environment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Building a good infrastructure from the beginning is as important as building a strong economy. A good infrastructure can guarantee a good future in that area if not the best. But the infrastructure should not be a threat to the environment. Because environment is the only reason we can build, we can drink, we can develop. If the environment is not taken care of, environment won`t be able to take care of us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Economy and infrastructure go hand in hand. They both help each other in becoming as asset to the field. A company with good infrastructure is sure to get economically strong as time goes by (if not at same time). A company which is economically strong can build a good infrastructure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; In the early years of a company, it has to get economically strong first. Then only it can think about saving environment and other things. Let`s take the example of "Building apartments in Hyderabad". Around 20 years back when there was lot of empty space to build there were any cases of overflowing of drainage. Whenever it rained the water will either evaporate or get sucked by earth. Now after 20 years, we have no empty place . When it rains heavily, rain water has no way out. All the place covered by concrete or cement or roads. That`s why even a small rain causes water pools in the middle of roads. That`s because of our negligence on environment (or we can call it our inability to see the future).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;There is an opt solution for the above problem. It`s called "Green buildings". It was introduced in USA first and some of our cities are also adopting it. A green building has a good number of plants and trees, some open place for water to sink. And they have electricity generating from in-house solar devices. This kind of houses save our environment in this particular area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A chemical company which is in its beginning years is small and produces less waste. If it is an old and big one it will produce lots of wastage and wherever the wastage is dumped it affects the people living near by. So when you are a small company you need focus more on your growth. But when you have become a big one, your responsibilities increase. You shouldn`t harm the environment and you have to help saving it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The main thing is that being economically strong, efficient in infrastructure is a must in the begginning. But when you are in safe zone shift your focus little onto saving the environment not just on the growth of the company. Planning should be done in such a way that it serves the purpose and at the same time it shouldn`t affect the environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:SouthKorea2013EconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;South Korea is becoming strong in the areas of construction, ivestments and exports. The evidence is that 2013`s first quarter`s GDP growth is best in the past 2 years. And the prediction of future is that it will go higher and higher, the reason being esaing of the fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy. I Korae there is low unemployment and low inflation so the consumption spending might get lucky. So South Korea`s economy`s path is only upwards except investment is remailning comparatively weak. As the global trade cycle is moving up and domestic consumer sentiment is improving investment might get strong. but there is less growth rate in China and Eurozone is weak now so the possibility of recovery is going to be late, says the exports front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospects which are enhancing industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment has made economic activities more frequent. &amp;nbsp;Industril production has been decreasing since last two years but this year it is 1.7 percent. Same is the case with purchasing manager`s index figures because of the activies from both domestic and foreign and domestic being higher. By growing consumer sentiment it can said that it is good for domestic consumer growth and the fact bring its low performance in first quarter. In april Bank of kora`s composite consumer sentiment index was 102 and in may it was 104 which is one year`s high. Because there was low inflation consumption growth will increase. From the recently approved fiscal stimulus plan and monetary policy easing it can be said that consumption and investment will incease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy changing gears to support economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In may, South Korea parliament decided to ratify 4.8 billion dollars plan to help small and medium enterprises, increase the worker`s salary, increase the corporate investments and real estate by tax deductions. The government is doing this to enhance GDP by 0.3 per cent and create 40,000 jobs. That package is only a part of 15.4 billion dollars supplementary budget. So the fiscla deficit might rise about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 whereas previous target was 0.3 percent. Low level of public debt (36% of GDP) , current account surplus (3.8 % of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold) so sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise and the deficit is manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monetary policy easing will complement fiscal push this year.To boost the growth rate and prevent&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen, BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May because inflation at 14-year low (1.0 percent) which is below its target rate (2.5-3.5 percent). In the six past months yen has decreased its value more than 20 percent againsy the won. So the BOK`s plan has the ability and possibility to break this trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
