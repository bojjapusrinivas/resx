<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/27/2015 5:12:21 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our dependence on computers has increased tremendously. Right from running a school to a railway system or an aeroplane, we are depepndent on computers. Do you think, our lives are going to become more dependent on computers as technology advances? Is this dependence good for our overall development? Give reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, in my view the usage of computer has increased tremendously in today`s scenario.The technology has rapidly increased were we can see that every educational institution is following the smart class concept and the every organisation is totaly dependent on the technology were they think that the work load is getting reduced &amp;nbsp;and employees are working efficiently. The upcoming generation has to deal with updated technology,the manpower has been utilised less and work is going to be completed on time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The advancement in tecnology can also contribute in the growth of economy where people are good at handling things with the help of tecnology and make sure that the work is correct and the data is safe and secure.caomputer has made things easier campared to earlier days where the internet facility made the information available at their finger tips. Internet has become the medium for learning thing on their own .Not only the educational institutions or the IT sectors are using the tecnology but the people who are at home are also making themselves updated with the tecnology by learining how to &amp;nbsp;operate and make use of it. The computers also got advancement in them like digital computers ,laptops etc...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Usage of computers is since long and the main objective is &amp;nbsp;to store and retrive data whenever needed.The total dependence is quite good because its actully the core element which is used every where .The railway stations and busstops ,they use computers for a computrised output which hepls in getting tickets printed and and be stored if the passenger need and their is a record of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world in todays scenerio is on one monitor screen and that is `COMPUTER`.Each and every information is available on the search engine that is GOOGLE. Which provide the information for every question ,not only the information but the booking of railway tickets which made easy &amp;nbsp;rather than standing in queue and getting tickets booked, or lodging a room in hotel.The google maps also made easy it for the people to find the loactions with the help of GPRS.The telecom industry is providing a good network facility of internet and making use of it efficiently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The people who are trading internationally ,with the help of computers they are able to provide the data or any information which the client wants and the transaction are also done online where it is safe and secure.Computer not only has the search engine but also the microsoft office which helps in making presentation &amp;nbsp;,preparing the statistical data and many more.Wthe the help of computers the environment is under control because of less usage of paper work and cutting od trees has reduced to alot of extent. The overall development can be considered in the advancement of tecnology as every sector like the banking,railway station, parliament,educational intitutions,comapanys,are using computers according to their usage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;conclusion: In my view the advancement of tecnology can contribute to the development of the country which is indeed making the less usage of manpower and the work is done on time with accuracy and it also assured that the data is safe and secure.The internet has made easy learning,which the upcoming generation will enhance their skills and capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013AutoIndustryOutlookforAsia&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Auto Industry Outlook for Asia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As India and China are the only countries in Asia, where the economy is rapidly growing it is assumed that the Auto Industry will attain a rapid growth upto 40% in next 5 to 7 years.The &amp;nbsp;ford automotive company anticipates that the sale of small cars willl increase from the asian countries,presently its 48% sales and later in 2020 ,the sales may hike upto 55%.the growth in economy cam lead the sales as the demand for the prodcuct is also increasing.The global sales of ford by 2015 where 50-% to 8 miilion vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 - Auto Industry Outlook for Asia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Asia Promises High Growth &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The Asian countries, especially China and India, are expected to account for 40% of growth in the auto industry over the next five to seven years being the rapidly growing economies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Ford anticipates global sales to expand by 50% to 8 million vehicles by 2015 given the potential growth in Asia, mainly China and India; and rising demand for small cars. The automaker anticipates small cars to account for 55% of the total sales by 2020 compared with 48% presently. One third of the small car sales are expected to come from Asia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In late 2012, Ford announced plans to boost exports of its engine production from India by shipping them for the first time to Europe. Currently, the automaker exports 40% of its Indian-made engines and 25% of its Indian-made cars to 35 countries. The company expects to manufacture 450,000 cars and 600,000 engines in India by 2015. It already pumped in $2 billion to build manufacturing facilities in India. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In April this year, General Motors revealed plans to build four new plants in China in order to boost annual production capacity to 5 million vehicles and triple its exports from Chinese plants by 2015. GM and its joint venture partners in China plan to invest $11 billion in the country by 2016 as part of their major expansion program. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In 2009, China overtook the U.S. as the biggest auto market in the world by sales volumes when the Beijing government introduced a stimulus package, including tax incentives for small cars. China accounted for a third of light vehicle sales growth in the last five years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However, the incentives were scrapped in 2011 and the Beijing government imposed quotas on new car registrations in order to control the traffic congestions. In 2012, sales in China grew 4.3% to 19.3 million units, which is lower than the 8% growth projected by China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) as well as the double-digit growth in 2009 and 2010. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Auto sales in the country are expected to improve if the government renews some of its policy incentives that helped the country overtake the U.S. as the biggest auto market. According to the Chinese government, total vehicle sales in China are expected to rise 7.8% to 20.8 million vehicles in 2013 from 19.3 million last year, led by strong demand for passenger vehicles and economic recovery. The CAAM believes SUVs will remain the fastest-growing segment in the year while commercial vehicles will record a moderate gain in sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
