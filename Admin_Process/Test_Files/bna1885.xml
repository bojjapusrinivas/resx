<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/26/2015 5:09:03 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualified people from developing countries move to developed or rich countries in search of a better position, profile, work and money. Do you think this brain drain is making the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer? Discuss the pros and cons of brain drain, and measures to check this phenomenon? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;As far as my knowledge is concerned, most of the people from developing countries move to developed and rich countries to enhance their position. We know man requires money. He also tries to enhance his bank balance, therefore he/she tries for a better oppurtunity, where he can make lots and lots of money. Most of the students after completion of their graduation, who want to pursue their MS are leaving India which is a developing country and going to developed country like US in order to complete their studies over there. After completion of MS also, most of the people are willing to settle their because of high salary. As it is a known fact that Indian rupee value is less when compared to US, Europe and some other countries, so they think that they can make lot of money. This is one of the reason why people are choosing developed countries to settle who give importance in making money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The other most important reason &amp;nbsp;why people leave the home country is for bertter oppurtunity. For instance, if we consider India, the labour cost is very less compared to some developed countries. So people will obviously take a decision to make more money for the same job. Doing same job but earning &amp;nbsp;more money attracted him to emerge to some developed country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;This will surely effect the economy of the both the countries. It is making rich countries richer and poor countries poorer as this effects &amp;nbsp;their employment rate, exporting capacity, which shows impact on GDP, therefore the country which is already developed further grows making the situation of poorer or developed country still worst and rich and developed country more richer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; There are only few people in the country who go to other countries, pursue their higher studies, earn money for few days and get in to the field of enterpreneurship or get a job in the home country. This is a good thing for the developing countries, but only few people opt for this due to lot of drawbacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;But i Think this situation in our country is slowly changing, where India get transformed to developed country with many oppurtunities . Narendra Dhamodhardas Modi, the Prime Minister of India, a mascot to our country is trying to push the bad situations away by launching many schemes in our country. When we consider a scheme "MAKE IN INDIA", an appreciatable scheme, fosters the economy of India, which stops people moving fom India to developed country, because this scheme encourageds FDI and enterpreneurship oppurtunities in India, so people will try to stay in their home country looking at the oppurtunities and growth. Oppurtunitie are really increasing in our country, so home country people will not run to other countries searching for them. Narendra Modi in his speech recently told that FDI is "for developing &amp;nbsp;India" rather than saying it "Foreign Direct Investment". He also implemented 47% FDI in defence which creates lot of oppurtunities. India is going to become a manufacturing hub in the coming days. So a person like Modi who think diplomatic is present in country, the situation will surely change &amp;nbsp;where people dont go to other countries to make money and ultimately boosts the economy of &amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:SouthKorea2013EconomicOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea economic conditions are getting better. it has been observed that tthere is an increase in the rate of GDP in the first quarter of 2013. athoush the investments remained same the exports of Korea showed a growth which became aprt of growth in GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing industry developed. Manufacturing industry received lot of orders which shows the consumers of manufacturing industry enhanced, where consumersv are willing to spend. so it lead to increase in the production(1.7 percent growth in ayear). new orders were the main reason for growth of production and economy. Increase in the production increased both domestic and foreign orders. There is an additional budget of $15.4 billion supplementary by the government, which should be funded only through borrowing.. therefore the fiscal deficit raised to 1.8 percent of GDP from previous target of 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korean parliament ratified &amp;nbsp;A$4.8 BILLION Plan to improve small and medium scale enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP had grown with 0.3% and created lot of jobs in the fist quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In the month of may, there was an inflation at a 14 year low(1.0 percent year over year). The BOK increased policy rate by 25 basis points to foster the growth to protect itself from Japanese yen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea - 2013 Economic Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s economy appears to be on its way up, as economic indicators and policy action point to improving growth prospects. Quarterly GDP growth hit a two-year high in the first quarter of 2013, aided by strong showing in construction, investment, and exports. Encouragingly, the pace of expansion is expected to pick up as fiscal stimulus measures and monetary policy easing start to have an impact. Among the key components, consumption spending is likely to benefit from low unemployment and a boost to real wages from low inflation. Despite a better showing in Q1 2013, investment remains relatively weak. However, it is expected to edge up as domestic consumer sentiment improves and the global trade cycle moves up. On the exports front, recovery in the near term is likely to be muted given continued Eurozone weakness and declining growth rates in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving prospects for industry and consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic activity has got a boost from a gradual strengthening of industrial output and consumer sentiment. Industrial production growth turned positive (1.7 percent year over year) in April after two previous contractions. On similar lines, purchasing managers&amp;rsquo; index figures for the month show manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years. Growth was driven by new orders, both domestic and foreign, although the former&amp;rsquo;s pace of expansion was higher. This augurs well for domestic consumption growth in the second quarter, given its subdued performance in Q1 2013. This view is supported by growing consumer sentiment: The Bank of Korea&amp;rsquo;s (BOK&amp;rsquo;s) composite consumer sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index went up to 104 in May from 102 in April, and matches the one-year high in March. Along with improving perceptions of economic activity, consumption growth is also likely to benefit from low inflation (which aids real wage growth) and low unemployment. Most importantly, both consumption and investment are likely to benefit from a recently approved fiscal stimulus plan as well as monetary policy easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin policy push: Fiscal and monetary policy gear up to support the economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the South Korean parliament ratified a $4.8 billion stimulus plan to aid small and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium enterprises, prop up worker incomes, and boost corporate investments and the real estate sector through tax incentives. The government expects these measures to push up GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points and create 40,000 jobs. The stimulus package is part of a $15.4 billion supplementary budget by the new government, to be funded entirely through new borrowing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from a previous target of 0.3 percent. However, the deficit is manageable, and sovereign risk perceptions are not likely to rise given the low level of public debt (36 percent of GDP), current account surplus (3.8 percent of GDP), and high total reserves ($323 billion excluding gold).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal push this quarter has been complemented by monetary policy easing. With inflation at a 14-year low (1.0 percent year over year) in May and well below its target rate of 2.5&amp;ndash;3.5 percent, the BOK eased its policy rate by 25 basis points in May to boost growth and prevent the South Korean won&amp;rsquo;s sharp rise against the Japanese yen. In the six months prior to the rate cut, the yen had fallen more than 20 percent against the won, denting South Korea&amp;rsquo;s export competitiveness vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Japan. The BOK&amp;rsquo;s move is likely to help break this trend.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
