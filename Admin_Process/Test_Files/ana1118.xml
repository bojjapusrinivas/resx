What do you think are the major steps that can be taken by the government to improve patient care in the Country?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In a country like India, there is an enormous gap between healthcare supply and demand. And Government of India&amp;nbsp;must some&amp;nbsp;serious actions&amp;nbsp;to improve patient care in the Country. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe the main reasons for enormous gap&amp;nbsp;between healthcare supply and demand are Poverty,&amp;nbsp; Politics, Lack of&amp;nbsp;Education in people, Lack of medical facilities etc&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Poverty is one of the main reason,&amp;nbsp;as middle class , low&amp;nbsp;class&amp;nbsp;people cant efford to buy costly medicines.&amp;nbsp;As example if a person from a low class family is suffering from Cancer.&amp;nbsp;Then regular Medical&amp;nbsp;treatment like Keemo Thearpy, Radiation, Injections etc are compulsary for the patient survival&amp;nbsp;. And&amp;nbsp;the cost of the Medical treatment is&amp;nbsp;very high, which a common man cant afford for them. So, for this the govenment should take some action like&amp;nbsp;providing good medical facilities in hospitals for the&amp;nbsp;people&amp;nbsp;,by&amp;nbsp;providing with insurance and reducing the prize of the medicines and treatment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Politics is one of the main drawback. Because of some corrupted Politicians there is a gap between healthcare supply and demand&amp;nbsp;. These Politicains do several scams like taking the hospitals for lease, and charge for more money from the patients. Here the Doctors and the Politcians are interconnected with each other. This effects the patients and the economy growth of our country also. These Politicains take the medical contracts from the govenment and use for there own profits. This problem can be solved , by choosing the correct leaders who are not corrupted, and who are really willing to serve the country. And these Politicans build up several Medical Institutes and ,Instead of taking the students on the merit bases. The Politcians sell the seats to the Students who pay more Donation for the institute. Due to which talented students are effected. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lack of Education , is one of the main reason . If there is proper education system in our country, We will never face any problem. As people will be aware of the circumstances going in the country. They will have proper medical knowledge about how to deal with any healthcare problems. Like example Aids is caused because of sexual intercourse. So Condoms must be used to stop disease like Aids. So for this proper education must be given to aware the people from the right age. So that people are aware of the disease. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lack of Medical Facilities, in our country is one of the major drawback. Well some medicines are manufactured only in foreign contries. And these medicines are not available in India. So govenment of India should make some labaratories and develop such medicines so that the to improve patient care in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So these are the problems and the steps should be taken by the government to improve patient care in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
