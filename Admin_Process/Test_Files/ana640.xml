What can be done to minimize the disparity between rural and urban areas in India?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I definitely, am of the opinion that living in big cities offer benefits in comparison to rural areas. WIth big cities come bigger opprotunities and comfort. I am not trying to generalize the term &amp;quot;Rural&amp;quot; here because there is peace of mind that comforts our soul in a rural area.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Urban areas, no doubt can groom a person and prepare him or her to face the challenge in the competitive world. But as Griffith says &amp;quot;No Research is Perfect&amp;quot;, so I cannot just say that cities groom an individual to meet the challenges of the outside world. How can we forget about our Ex-President Mr. Abul Kalam Azad, who is a synonym for the word &amp;quot;Intellect&amp;quot;. He was born and raised in a small town of South India, his parents had imbibed his soul with values that they carried always and taught him to shower that values to the world. I recently came across a Chai wala named Laxman Rao, in ITO, and to my surprise, he is no ordinary man, he is a writer of Hindi Novels. He came across to me as a very normal person, selling tea to earn his living because writing gives him loyalty not money. Such gesture or effort can be seen only within a soul that has seen the rural part of India. When we try to find one, we fail to find one such example from Urban India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Despite the fact that India is growing and developing with time, there is a thin line that is dividing India into two halves that is - Urba India and Rural India. If we see places like New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Goa, Hyderabad, Guwahati etc, we make an opinion that &amp;quot;India is a developed country&amp;quot;. On the other hand, if we visit places like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Some places in Assam and North East, Dehradoon etc, we have a contradicting opinion that &amp;quot;India still has to develop&amp;quot;. Why such disparity? I think we, as the residents of India need to take few steps towards minimizing this disparity in India. Here are a few points that I can suggest-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Roads are seen to be barren and not structured, why not a person from each urban city is chosen as a spoc(single point of contact), who would go around visiting places of Rural India, and cascade the information to the Urban Authority who, in turn would raise this to the rural authority and some steps to bring a harmony in both the areas of India is taken.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government should start investing time and money in developing those rurar and isolated areas of India, because that investing can bear sweet fruits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools and colleges with the same standard as is seen in the urban areas of India, to be opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children from the rural areas should be given sex education so that they know what is the true world and how sex can make or break a society. It was found in a recent survey that rapists in India mostly belong to the rural part of India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By just jotting down my points, I dont think we can change the society, we need to set examples so that the above written lines are implemented and results seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provisions in Urban areas of India should be provisions in the Rural part of India. By joining hands and working together, we can bring a difference. As the saying goes &amp;quot;United we stand and divided we fall&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope my piece of writing catches the eyes of the true leader who would take the stand to witness this change that can bring about a change to our country India. India has been setting examples to be one of the enduring nations, and I am sure with these small steps and working towards the goal can help it to toch the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
