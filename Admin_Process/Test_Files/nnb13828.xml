Is disinvestment really good for India or is a rethink required? Please take a stand and elaborate.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Investment means investing money in any companies to increase the capital for investors .so disinvestment means not investing money for investors .government have announced new disinvestment policy .these is good for india or not .so my opinion is to these policy is might know about details and advantages or disadvantage of the policy after that india can go for this policy.disinvestment policy means not investing .if investor have not to invest means they can have problem in improving their capital so these policy is not taken by india .if india has taken this policy means many invest can fall in risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My view is to not to take these policy if india has taken this policy investor will able to face problem in investing &amp;nbsp;in the companies .there is advantages and disadvantages of not taking these policy .advantages many of the companies can invest they share to investment.like mutual fund is a example for investor. disadvantage if the investor are investing means they can have problem and risk for investing the capital.if investor cannot take this policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Rethink can required for this if there s limit for investing the capital so there can consider this policy .if there is changes in this policy india can take this policy and also good for india for future uses india nsider this policy when this policy is useful for any investor .and new disinvestment policy can evalute for betterment for investor.if there is betterment for investor so easy can take this policy for india for success.many investor are investing in the mutual fund because there is less risk and more stable so investor are choosing these fund only .fund is very important for very person any organisation.investment is not a easy one very one can know about investment policy details and take the right step for selection.indian investor can think about this policy and if its is right means there can for these policy.few not do not take this policy with out knowing exact details of this policy.investment means totally related to funds only so be &amp;nbsp;care for taking these policy...indian government have give these opportunity but india is needed this policy for investor point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Thank you sir for giving this opportunity i have done my essay writing.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
