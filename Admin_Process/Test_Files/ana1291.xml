<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;5/30/2014 4:07:26 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the demand for foreign brands overtaken that for our home grown brands? How do Indian brands fare internationally in the era of globalization?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is a democratic country,where different segmments of people living with their own taste and preferences.I will certainly go with this statement that demand for foreign brands overtaken our home grown brands slowly.Because &amp;nbsp;today&amp;#39;s world is a dynamic world.Where so many cross border transactions is happenning &amp;nbsp;easily.Main factor responsible for above statement is globalisation of market ,which makes easier the &amp;nbsp;exchange of brands with each other.In the past we are bound to the country&amp;#39;s wall in terms of &amp;nbsp;market.But now we can go to any beyond as far as the brand is conerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;people are demanding variety of brand interms of cloth,food,transport,medicines and beverages etc.Thousands of &amp;nbsp;brands are being offered.Country like America,japan,China and Australlia are the leading Country &amp;nbsp;which influence India the most.Because the brand provided by the companies are of qualitative and more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now a days &amp;nbsp;a person can buy any brand online within a few second by sitting at home.For example if a person want to buy a foreign brand shirt,he or she can avail it by placing an respective order online ,within 3/4 working days the order will be at the door steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we all know we Indians are using more of foreign brands due to its quality, comforability and variety.The foreign brands are highly maintaing their brands in terms of researchand developement.So they are the present &amp;nbsp;global market leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case of India we are still lacking of areas like latest tecnology solution,timely research and development of &amp;nbsp;aproduct,new marketing strategic solution etc.Always highly qualitative brand appeals customer first.So therefore indian brands &amp;nbsp;fare. intrnationally but still long way to be compared as the other country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,incase of food and beverages India plays a vital role &amp;nbsp;due to its ancient culture and tradition.Allover the world Indian food is recognised as the most dellicious for its different spices and vigerous method.Because of our price and quality of the food we are reaching globally. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Indians are also reaching cross border in other brands like clothing and transport.In the near future India can be the leading global brand if it folllows appropriate stretegies &amp;nbsp;technically in the international market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
