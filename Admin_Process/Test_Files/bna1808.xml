<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2/23/2015 5:10:44 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological advancements and ever-changing work policies provide people with an option to work from home, rather than the office where they meet the team face to face. List out and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Technology has seen drastic changes. This field has always been emerging and has seen significant growth. The advancements in technology has greatly helped the nations connect with each other. It is no longer confined to using the internet on the computers but it is also advanced to using the mobile internet. Where everything was done manually is now being automated with the usage of technology. Technology is not restricted to usage of internet but it works as a catalyst. Almost every task&amp;nbsp;is carried out through the involvement of technology in one or the other stage. It is an evergreen field and has much scope for further developments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The latest advancement of technology is the use of the robotics. These robots respond to people and can move from their place. Roomba Robotics can be another example of robots where the task of cleaning is assigned to the robots through the computer program that is fed to it. The other technology changes can the use of advanced security systems which include eye scanning, finger prints, voice recognition etc. These assure safety to the user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Another emerging technology advancement is the voice recognition software. Today even companies use the voice recognition softwares to feed the data to the system. This has greatly hepled the companies to save time and energy and the number of people required for perfoming the task. One example of such software can be "Speech to Text" software which accepts the commands according to the speaker and his tone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The most common advancement seen is the use of internet which is not only accessible through the computer systems but also through mobile phones. The various applications help connect with each other eliminating the distance which would have otherwise been a hindrance. Companies also transfer information through the use of &lt;span class="italic"&gt;Intranet, Electronic Data Interchange, Extranet etc. There are ofcourse various policies that the companies have to stick to, for the use of such data. Online transactions are also possible through its use. Online Banking services, e-commerce etc. are yet to receive popularity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Though technology has shown great signs of growth and helped people connect with each other, it has its own pros and cons. Some of its advantages are as follows-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;ADVANTAGES:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1. Faster access to work- Where manual work used to take hours for completion, through the use of technology it has greatly been cut down to seconds. E-mails and online orders can be given as examples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2. Communication is no longer a barrier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3. Reduces the work stress and burden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;4. Technology usage has become mandatory and hence even people from rural areas are encouraged to gain knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;5. It has attracted the FDI and hence many employment opportunities are opened which demand for computer knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;DISADVANTAGES:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1. Reduced face to face communication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2. Technology, though successfully emerged faces problem in the correction of errors, if any.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3. When it comes to using internet, security is a big cause of worry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;4. Technology upgradation is very necessary for companies. Failure of the same may result in losses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Despite the above mentioned cons, technology has been growing successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:June2013GlobalAutoIndustryOutlook&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auto industry is a highly concentrated one which accounts for nearly 80% of the worldwide production and 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market shares of the companies during the first five months in the year 2013, in order of the market share they hold are as follows-General Motors Company with 18.0%, Ford Motors with 16.4%, Toyota Motors Corp. with 14.2%, Chrysler-Fiat with 11.7% and Honda Motor with 9.5% and Nissan Motors Company with 8.1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Toyota gained the market share by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally which exceeded the sales of General Motors with 9.29 million vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPPORTUNITIES:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be competitive the automakers will have to design vehicles at low cost for consumers in both mature and emerging industries using advanced technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the " One Manufacturing" strategy taken by Ford aims at producing multiple models from plants across the globe to save production costs and to adapt to changing tastes of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automakers are also concentrating on the offering more optional features that will reduce the costs incurred on gas even on less guzzler vehicles. The purpose of optional features is to offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to large trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automakers are now shifting their production facilities from high cost regions like North America and European Union to lower cost regions such as China, India and South America. According to CSM Worldwide, studies have revealed that China and South America represented more than 50% &amp;nbsp;of growth in global light vehicle production in auto industry between 2008-2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government plays a significant role as the energy and environmental policies will be greatly responsible for moulding the industry. In 2011, 2013 major automakers including Ford, GM, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover etc. signed letters of commitment with the U.S. governmetn to upgrade the fuel eceonomy, standard of cars and light duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;June 2013 &amp;ndash; Global Auto Industry Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The auto industry is highly concentrated. The top 10 global automakers account for roughly 80% of the worldwide production and nearly 90% of total vehicles sold in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In the first five months of 2013, General Motors Company ( GM ) led with a 18.0% market share in the U.S., followed by Ford Motor Co. ( F ) with a 16.4% market share, Toyota Motors Corp. ( TM ) with a 14.2% market share, Chrysler-Fiat with a 11.7% market share, and Honda Motor Co. ( HMC ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( NSANY ) at the last spots with 9.5% and 8.1% market shares, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Toyota recaptured the sales crown from General Motors by selling 9.75 million vehicles globally in 2012, which exceeded GM`s sales of 9.29 million vehicles. Germany`s Volkswagen AG ( VLKAY ) came third with sales of 9.07 million vehicles for the year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;OPPORTUNITIES &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;To remain competitive, the automakers will need to design vehicles that will cater to consumers in both mature and emerging markets while manufacturing them at low-cost using the most advanced technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;For example, Ford has undertaken "One Manufacturing" strategy, which aims at producing multiple models from plants across the world in order to save production costs and fast adaptation to changes in consumer tastes. The automaker anticipates producing 4.5 models at each of its plants by 2015, up from 3.6 models currently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Further, the automakers are concentrating on offering more optional features (which will save money on gas), even on the small and less gas-guzzler vehicles in order to attract buyers. The sale of optional features is helping them offset lower profit margins for small cars relative to large trucks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The automakers continue to shift their production facilities from high-cost regions such as North America and the European Union to lower-cost regions such as China, India and South America. According to a study by CSM Worldwide, China and South America together will represent more than 50% of growth in global light vehicle production in the auto industry from 2008 to 2015. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The role of governments is highly significant. Their energy and environmental policies will be strongly responsible in molding the auto industry in the coming years. In late 2011, 13 major automakers, including Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Volvo, have signed letters of commitment with the U.S. Government to upgrade the fuel economy standard of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
