Do you think this brain drain is making the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer? Discuss the pros and cons of brain drain, and measures to check this phenome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualified people from the developing countries move to developed countries &amp;nbsp;in search of better positions, better profile ,good work life and with handful expected money this is a boon to the developing technology ,as if there is development to the technology it will reduce the man power. The works and the task can be done &amp;nbsp;with a good ease with high efficiency by using the machinery and gadgets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;People think for their own benefits and for self development and they migrate to other countries which offer them with good high packages &amp;nbsp;of their salaries so that man can improve his financial status. Qualified people,well talented people instead of working with in their own country and improve the countries economy, poverty line, education standards, countries standards they migrate to the other countries which is a big draw back to the one`s own country .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If all the well qualified people and well educated people leave the country then countries economical situation will go down with which there will not be any development in the country and for everything country should depend on other nations let it be in terms of technical wise or education wise. If countries standards will go down then even young youth of the country will also migrate to other developed nations for education purpose and they will never return back and will choose &amp;nbsp;the luxorious life with handful of money which the richer countries are paying them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many advantages if all the educated people work together there will be a technological boom . When all the experts work under the same roof then they can interchange their ideas and work for excellence . When there is any problem faced in terms of technical way or interms of task completions then it will help each other to execute any task. where developing a software is not a easy one it requires a lot of experts with lots of task accomplishments which requires implementation phase, development phase, designing phase, testing phase, and finally introducing that product into the market and this all is possible with the help of many scientist and experts working together as a part of team. By this nations can be developed with good profits reduce the task which is very hard to the man kind which will earn good life being at last what humans need is only a luxorious life which can reduce all his efforts and difficult jobs and this is possible only with the developed technology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When experts and qualified people from developing countries move to developed or rich countries in search of a better position, profile, work, and money then this will reduce the countries GDP profits , reduce the countries exports , where we should depend on the other countries for each and everything let it be interms of educations, softwares, technology, hospitality, standars, medicines etc. Instead of people migrating to the developed countries they can form a council in the same country where all the high qualified people, scientist, people with great knowledge &amp;nbsp;work together for all aspects of the country and can promote countries economy. Now recently there is a particular development called make in India(this is the case in our country) when we promote this make in india programme then there will more job oppurtunies, many developments in the industries, high sustainability of the markets where countries markets share can be increased . We can have many foreign investments in our country which will develop countries standards because our conutry is still in the list of developing countries rather than the developed countries. So young youth of the country should be educated well and trained well in developing countries profits and countries economy they should be monitored that they won`t leave the country for richer packages and life styles. If developing countries work with these policies of developing nations with all the experts and well qualified people then one day it will sure lead to the countries success then the rival countries and other countries will depend on country like us if it is developed well in all standards, which is a big boon for the country which will increase its standards and well being of the people living in it then no one will leave their own country and migrate to other countries for developing their standards. Then country like us can also be in the list of developed country and richer country in all terms.Then there will be lots of exports, new employements, market developments etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:ChinaEconomicOutlookfo2013&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China growth was only 7.7 percent in the first quarter which was much disappointing for many experts and analysts as the China growth was expected to be around 8-9 percent. Now Chinas government is determined to reset its expectations now the government is forecasting its expectations to 7.5 percent which is certainly slower than the growth rate 7.8 percent which was recorded in the year 2012 and this was the slowest rate in the 13 years. &amp;nbsp;Premier Li Keqiang, in a recent speech in Germany, said that growth for the remainder of the decade will average lower 7.0 percent per year. Although far slower than the growth experienced during the past two decades, he also indicated that China is &amp;ldquo;entering a range of reasonable growth. China has become more mature country in terms of declining labour force. More over growth of 7.0 percent is not a bad one it doubles GDP in 10 years. Li said that a combination of industrialization, urbanization, improvements in agricultural productivity, and investments in technology can contribute to healthy growth, and that this requires more market-oriented reforms. He also said that &amp;ldquo;for a very big economy, this is not easy.&amp;rdquo; Because of its uncertainity situations. It will take time to build good implemented reforms. China also faces many risks including the ramifications of large local government debt, considerable leverage in the shadow banking system, and weaker-than expected manufacturing activity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing weakness stems from weakness in export markets. In addition rising wages in china has adverse impact on the competitiveness. If the situation is the same then the growth rate of 7-8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves China`s economic relationships with other countries. Now it is saying that it will join Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP) to create free trade in Pacific Basin and currently there are 12 countries involved in this they are United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. If China joins this group, then TPP will increase for more than half of global GDP. Freer trade will not only be a term in lowering tariffs and quotas it will also be an important component. It will also provide space for domestic markets which will freely compete with foreign companies. This will lead China to positive development like creating pressure to private state-run companies, create a good competition in private markets and private sectors and will allow free movement of prices of goods and credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China &amp;ndash; Economic Outlook for 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fast can China grow? That is the question underlying much of the discussion about China&amp;rsquo;s economy these days. Clearly, double digit growth is not in the cards and may even be a thing of the past. Growth of 7.7 percent in the first quarter was considered disappointing, and, until recently, many analysts were expecting growth to revert to the range of 8&amp;ndash;9 percent. Yet now the government appears determined to reset expectations. The government has forecast that growth this year will be 7.5 percent, a good deal lower than many private analysts had forecast only recently. That is certainly slower than the 7.8 percent growth in 2012, which was the slowest rate of growth in 13 years. Premier Li Keqiang, in a recent speech in Germany, said that growth for the remainder of the decade will average an even lower 7.0 percent per year. Although far slower than the growth experienced during the past two decades, Li indicated that China is &amp;ldquo;entering a range of reasonable growth.&amp;rdquo; Given that China has become a more mature economy with a declining labor force, Li is probably correct in setting more modest expectations. Moreover, growth of 7.0 percent is not bad: It doubles the GDP in 10 years. Li said that a combination of industrialization, urbanization, improvements in agricultural productivity, and investments in technology can contribute to healthy growth, and that this requires more market-oriented reforms. He also said that &amp;ldquo;for a very big economy, this is not easy.&amp;rdquo; When and how such reforms will be implemented remains uncertain. While some reforms have been announced, many government statements have been relatively vague. With a new regime just installed, it could take some time to build the support necessary to implement much needed reforms. In the interim, China faces some risks, including the ramifications of large local government debt, considerable leverage in the shadow banking system, and weaker-than expected manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing weakness stems from weakness in export markets. In addition, rising wages in China are having an adverse impact on export competitiveness, thereby leading to an exodus of manufacturing capacity. Thus, even growth in the range of 7&amp;ndash;8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further global integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves China&amp;rsquo;s economic relationship with the rest of the world. China&amp;rsquo;s government now says it will study the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP), an effort to create a free-trade area in the Pacific Basin. Currently there are 12 countries involved in this effort: the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. If China joins the group, the TPP will collectively account for more than half of global GDP. Freer trade would entail not simply lowering tariffs and quotas, although this would be an important component. It would also involve freeing up domestic markets so that they would have to compete freely with foreign companies. From China&amp;rsquo;s perspective, this could be a positive development in that it would create pressure to privatize state-run companies, create a level playing field for the private sector, and allow free movement of prices of goods and credit. Still, agreement on the TPP is probably a long way off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
