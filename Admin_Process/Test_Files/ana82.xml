Please take a stand and discuss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;On the world map, India ha marked up its presence in many ways in today&amp;#39;s world, be it in a field of science and tecnology, economic growth, fashion statements any significant area where world look upto, India has made its presence significantly. One of the most important issue that has been always a matter of discussion on the global scale is rapidly growing population of India. lets discuss about pros and cons of presence of more than one billion Indians on the world map.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;while India as a nation is working hard to be considered as developed nation among all the nations, and to stabilise its economic issues, growing population at such a large extent can be a hurdle for the same. Why a&amp;nbsp;growth in population is a problem for India ? since India is a developing nation it has limited resources, be it natural resources or economic resources, some times government who is actually responsible for the people of its nation fails to provide basic neccessities of life&amp;nbsp;to all, even today also almost 40% of the total population of India is uneducated, since due to lack of proficient skills in people they are unable to perform any better work profile and&amp;nbsp;are not even able to sustain their livlihood. lack of education will lead to less amount of income and large number of family size as well and&amp;nbsp;here in&amp;nbsp;India we have a family culture so sometimes a whole family dependes on one male member of the family. So a failure of one male member will impact the whole family, if a person has to feed 8 people and he is uneducated and not profiecient enough that will lead him to commit either any kind of crime to fullfill its need or to end his life sometimes alongwith family memebers too. Both of the scenario are a negitive sign of a country&amp;#39;s development. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India is a big nation and a combination of different kinds of lands and gifts of nature in the form of natural resources, but they are also limited&amp;nbsp;to a certain extent. now a days, due to lack of knowledge our natural resources are being exploited, which are actually can be served as an asset to the country&amp;#39;s economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Just counting on numbers and saying that being present in a large number is a problem is not right. India has learnt a lot from past mistakes and is working hard to come over it. As said its not only quantity but quality also what matters. Today Indians have make their presence felt in world due to their hard work and knowledge, even world&amp;#39;s super power USA has an advisor of Indian origin in their cabinet. India has used this issue&amp;nbsp;in their growth perspective as well. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India has been a tourist place always, people from all over the world are very fond of our cultural art works and our heritage as well,&amp;nbsp;so even people who are less educated or uneducated but are well connected to their&amp;nbsp;cultural proffession like handicrafts,&amp;nbsp;paintings, artistic work over clothes and all, they have also proved as an positive factor to the&amp;nbsp;nation&amp;#39;s growth and making its identity wordwide.&amp;nbsp;Not only this even world&amp;#39;s big multinational companies has made India its biggest hub for outsourcing since they find more people to work in India at less price, also people are hardworking and know value for money.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In my opinion I would say that being present in a number of more than one billion was a problem some time back for India but now it has been slowly changing to the pool of opportunities. By providing basic knowledge to sustain and basic necessities of life things are changing, in a country like Austrailia where its actual population is that of whole Delhi, its a pleasure for them if anyone who is hardworking and trustworthy could come and work over their locations as they do not have work force but ample amount of natural resources which had helped them in attaining economic stability, but what about people ?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;its like making a huge and a beautiful palace but no one to live within. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Whole length of the discussion ends at a proven fact that, yes, more than one billion of Indians was a problem but now it has been changing to a sea of opportunities.&amp;nbsp;India is developing rapidly and&amp;nbsp;status of the&amp;nbsp;nation&amp;nbsp;depends upon its people, people are understanding importance of education, and this will automatically suffies the problem in itself. To suffies, I would say, times have changed and so we are and have proved to the world how a country can grow and develop rapidly in a span of almost 65 years of independance, and all that what India has as an image and impact on the world is due to this population of more than one billion of population.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
