&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I &amp;nbsp;prefer better train first.every &amp;nbsp;persons are &amp;nbsp;come&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;learning stage .better training is required first.If they well are wel trained enough then &amp;nbsp;they can able able to understand the suiations and they can build their confidence and boosts then to acheive more in life. I believe india needed both bullet train and better trains . first if students are well educated in education level so better training will be available there.first indian education system should be changed and spoon feeding systems should be removed .Education should be able TO Improve analytical and reasoning abilities of students and lot of focus should be put of communication skills i think. this increases the confidence among students and if they are well trained at educational level they &amp;nbsp;can create wonders .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so in my scenario indian needed better trainig at educational level so that they can be able the handle the suiation in better way. they wil ready to adapt the changes and work hard for future growth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullet training is needed &amp;nbsp;in organisations so that they come to know the main purpose of training .If the base is strong at educational level then they can easily understand the purpose of training so they work hard for future growth of the company .india requires quality education not quantity education .there is no use of quantity education.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullet training mainly &amp;nbsp;spots on important issues and what actually the job is met for and very purpose is clearly spotted in bullet training .If the people are well trained enough &amp;nbsp;they wil mainly fosus on purpose a nmd creates goo dworking environmnet and health competion wil be create din the society.india wil move developing country to developed country .so training is very crucial in present scenario it wil improve the working skills technical abilities and also improve the reasoning abilities of people .so they wil ready to face any kind of suiation and training improves skills and capabilities of every individual.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training is must every where to move forward so they can clearly gain knowledge about what the company is about and also where they should focus on more through bullet training . The actual purpose is clearly displayed and the focused concertration wil be kept on important issues of job.The working capabilities wil be increases and the goal of the job is clearly determined through bullet training. clearly determined goal makes the individual focued and generates succes to the organisation and &amp;nbsp;good reputation if veery company trains well then wil no unemployement problems and which actually increases the economic growth of the society and overall development canbe seen in india.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so in my point of view bullet training is needed in organisations and better training should come from educational institutions. Well advanced &amp;nbsp;training &amp;nbsp;facilities should be made avaliable in educational institutions itself. so every individual can able to learn challenging abilities .It improves the performance of each and every individual . so india needed people with well educated and individuals who can face any kind of situation .The performance of people will depends on training.so my intention is india needed both bullet and better training.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
