&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;As India being a developing country Bullet trains may not be used much as we generally use tains for long distances and many people may not be able to afford for bullet trains.Thus instead of focusing on bullet trains if we are concentrating on proving better trains to the people we can increase the revenue to the government as railways are the major source of income to the central government and it leads to the economic development of the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; The major reason for choosing trains for travelling is,it is the cheapest means of transport but not because of convenience or any other reason.None of us can assure that we are convenient in travelling through train.We may get quality services in luxury trains but it is expensive which many of us wont prefer generally.If we are travelling through a local train we cant even expect basic cleanliness and we cant even question any one for that.We are accustomed for that kind of poor services offered by the railway department.If we are travelling for a long distance it is very difficult basically for the women to use the rest rooms in the trains,people scatter garbage wherever they want.Though it is a non smoking area we find people smoking in railway stations.People get into the trains without even having tickets and do all non sense stuff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The railway system should make all the necessary actions to see that there is no inconvenience for the passengers travelling through train and a committee should be made who are responsible for the overall cleanliness and to whom people can address all their querries and problems.We should make sure that people feel a safe and convenient environment in train so that we increase the number of people travelling through train and make it a best travel experience for the passengers.Basic facilities such as proper drinking water,clean rest rooms,safe and seperate seating facilities for ladies should be made available even in local trains.Special security team should be setup in every train to make sure that women do not face any security problems specially during night times.Instead of increasing the number of trains it would be fruitful if we are improving the quality of services offered to the passengers.Though they are providing transport facilities at a cheaper rate people are not satisfied with it as they are not able to deliver even the basic facilities which is very essential for our travel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; so the railway authority should make sure that they are providing better services to the passengers.If the railways of India is making a huge turnover without satisfying the people who are using its services what would be the case if its customers are happy with its services.The turnover of the system would increase like anything and inturn increases the revenue to the government which automatically leads to the economic development and wealth of the nation in the long run.Hence better trains better economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
