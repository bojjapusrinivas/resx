&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cashless economy is one of the aim of Digital India( making india) . Which was encouraged by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Cashless economy is nothing but doing the transactions such as payments, withdrawls,transfers of money&amp;nbsp; from one account to another through online I.e electronically . At the time of Demonitization and after Demonitization this cashless transactions have incresed a lot such as payments made to some of the apps such as paytm, tez, phone pay.have increases a lot and many people got educated on this and started doing cashless transactions through there credit and debit cards also known as plastic money. As digital india has encouraged many people got a good job oppurtunities and has improved there skills in IT sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;As for every aspect there as prons and cons , for cashless transactions also we are having advantages and some disadvantages also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. People got educated and every one is using smart phones and doing payments through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Our indian economy has incresed .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Fake currency has decresed .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.Time has saved a lot&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. We need not to go for banks and stay in a queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Paper work has decresed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.People are following the latest technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.People are doing smart work rather than hard work .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Advanced features are adopted&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10.Every market is incresing .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.Many IT companies have been developed after the digital india,and recruted many people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 . Transfers are made whith in a second .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. People feel more comfortable as the work is done by sitting at a one place&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14. Terrorism has decresed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15. Interest among the teenages to adopt this technology has incresed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16. GST Is paid , and there is a increse in the rate of indian economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantaes&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Many people dont want to accept this because it may include fraud and our accouts may be hacked&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Single and simple mistake can make a huge loss to the company or a person&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Every time password has to be generated and typed , by this the people get irritated .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. For every bussiness transaction our proof should be attached such as aadhar card or pan etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.Needs a lot of technical knowledge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.As all the transactions are made electronically many people may not follow this and dont want to adopt this .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Many times when users are more the servers gets disturbed and it wont works .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. As the server is low we may not get our work done and most of time we postpone it&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Everyone is not aware of this cashless transactions , people prefer the traditional method of payment only they feel that this is more secured than cashless payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. implementation is not upto the mark&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; so this is all about the prons and cons of cashless economy. And I conclude that digitals payments are secure enough for the indian economy to go cashless by having a good technical knowledge and experiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The topic is about Elevator and its growth and development ,as the asian countries are developing there is development of elevators indirectly,and incresing the revenue also, China is ready to accept the projects of elevators around the world . there is a rise in many countries&amp;nbsp;such as increse in no. of hospitals , buildings, offices, where the use of elevators are must. so the transportation is easy and comfortable with new infrastuctures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries such as France, Canada, UK are the major contributors for the smart elevators market revenue , this technology with advanced features will help to control and secure the smart elevators to cater the custom needs and end users such as in hospitals, offices, residentials , commercial, healthcare, industrials to provide comfort and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urban population has been incresed from Past two decades , so there is a need of a vertical growth till 2020, by this the demand for the smart&amp;nbsp; elevators increses, high rise in projects, and revenue incresess indirectly as there is a vertical growth. global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting there to smart elevators for the compitation ,Schindler elevator corporation hassuccesfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the&amp;nbsp; Union plaza office building .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This growth in elevator are the boon for the market growth, as the smart elevators are being used in offices, hospitals,hotels, lodges,financial institutions , malls and multiplexes.the stucture and desine of elevators differ from place to place and from different sectors , some of the residentials have lesser interfloor compared to commercial buildings. It depends upon the capacity such as the health care sector needs more spacious and comfort elevators and in retails , warehouses also , so these are desined according to there purpose and uses .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there is more traffic of people and users are more there is a consumption of large amount of energy. so the Gaint players in the market are innovating solutions for the less consumption of power and provides same costomer experience. i.e smart elevators .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi has developed a multi- elevator smart technology in 2011 which reduces the consumption nearly upto 10% .this technology focus on operational&amp;nbsp; efficiency during the peak hours if rush .And maximises the energy reduction when the elevator is not in use .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
