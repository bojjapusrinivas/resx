Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, absolutely changing attitude is more important than the movement. If the attitude of a person changes then without any doubt the change is possible. Firstly, the people should be aware of the problems faced if they are not clean. The campaigns should be conducted to make them aware. Secondly, what are the actions to be taken to get rid of those problem like infections etc. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Not only government we as citizens of our country we should take care our own nation. It is our own responsibility to change our nation into "CLEAN INDIA". As a responsible citizen our PM Narendra Modi started a movement "SWATCH BHARATH". What we are doing for our nation should be identified first. Change should start from an individual, from his attitude. then only movement wil become successful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; Make sure that your surrondings are clean. Dont hesitate to clean them if they are not. There is nothing wrong in doing our own work. It makes them to think. Making people aware is important and awareness is not enough it should be turned into action. Let us clean our nation together. JAI HINDH!!!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
