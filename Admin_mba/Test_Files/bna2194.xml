Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Awareness is very important to all the people in order to keep their sorroundings clean and tidy because it keeps them away from many problems which might occur in future due to untidy environment around.Our Prime Minister Sir Narendra Modi had launched a movement called Swatch Bharath,which means Clean India Campaign which infulenced many people around the cities and also villages.It has been greatly influenced by campaign programmes held by clelebrities in order to get awareness among the people.The saying goes "Cleanliness is next to Godliness" to the movement and they themselves starting swatch bharath near their sorroundings.Yes,change in attitudes of the people,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;that they should maintain their areas clean without any garbage near by.They started cleaning their sorroundings and roads with broom sticks and make the place clean and neat without any waste around.The modern cities got polluted with the pollution and garbage thrown here and there without any responsibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Ofcourse, the attitudes of the people had changed more after the movement,before the movement not all people have this thought like people in villages are not aware &amp;nbsp;about the cleanliness and all.So rapidly there is more growth and awareness among the people after the Swatch Bharath movement.So,they were aware of the pros and cons of the movement.Keeping our sorroundings clean is always good so that none of them faces health issues.The attitudes of the people got changed more after the movement.Even the children started keeping their sorroundings clean by throwing the waste papers in the dustbins.The dustins are setup in the each streets and lanes.People who are well bothered about the city and nation they bother about the society more than anyone else.They voluntarily keep the sorroundings clean like if they get to see waste papers on road they pick and through them in the dustbin. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;The awareness of the citizens got into picture by implementing into actions.Unless and until we keep our sorroundings clean and tidy there is more for us to be more healthy without any viral diseases that could occur in future without our knowledge,So people attitudes have been changed more than ever before this movemen&lt;/span&gt;t.&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;The movement got &amp;nbsp;more infulenced through celebreties because they took up the challenges of the co-celebrities by cleaning their sorrounding areas clean and swept them with broom sticks.The challenge passed on to the politicians also.The attitudes of the people change by awareness only.The awareness comes only through movemets like this.Even we held a Swatch Bharath campaign in our college premises.We cleant the sorroundings of our college which was covered by papers and dust.It is so tidy to see the place tidy.Now a days, the roads of the city got polluted more than ever before. After the movemet,the got realised and were able to change their attitudes and get a drastic change in their mindset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;People living in villages got influenced by the movement.Even they started following Swatch Bharath to keep their roads and sorroundings clean ande neat without any dust.But it is true that we have change in order to change th country.So the attitudes of the people change only where they get to realise what is the main misssion of the movement.The "mission" of the movement is to make India clean and green.Cleanliness leads to good health without any future consequences.It is far better to adopt the best alternative to keep ourselves healthy and hail without any problems that have more chances to occur in future.Many people lack awareness due to lack of knowledge,illiteracy,few people are irresponsible regarding few matters so they get to affect through many consequences in future.It is always advised that we though don`t know few things atleast we have to be able to ask others and know which is called getting awareness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Yes,the change in attitudes of the people is more essential than the movement.The movement is important but not to the extent of the people`s attitudes.People`s attitude change only through such movements and awareness do come only when they change and see any change in the environment.They might come either formally or informally.Obviously awareness is more important than the movement.Movement come into picture only for creating awareness among the people &amp;nbsp;and there is more scope for the people to change.This movement changed the scenario of many cities and villages regarding their cleanliness.Not only educated even people who are uneducated were more infulenced by this movement.The vision of the movement was to create awareness among the people.So,these kind of movements are more appreciated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;I conclude this,by saying Yes attitudes change is more important than the movement because unless and untill the attitudes change the movements cannot be successful.The movements get successful by creating awareness and converting them into actions.The essence of the movement is to create awareness and build a change in attitudes of the people.Thank You.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
