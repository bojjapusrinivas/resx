&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Government have to make a contract manufacturing with the private companies to set up the bullet trains to complete it in less time, With the bullet trains existence we have many benifits to india were employment will be generated, Means of transportation increases, It will generate revenue to the government. With the bullet train initiative it will effect the over all economy of the country.Initiative of bullet trains India needs to plan for infrastructure, Cost, It has to reach every corner of the country mainly in rural areas, Bring awareness among the people about benefits of &amp;nbsp;bullet train transportation. Cost play the major role were as most of the people in India is traditional and lives in &amp;nbsp;rural areas it should be such that every citizen has to be benefited and It should be affordable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;India being a developing country using the current tecnology effectively and efficiently will transform to developed country. One who want to reach the destination fast and affordable will prefer bullet trains to travel in the inter country than the airways transportation.Traveling around inter country places will be costly using airways &amp;nbsp;compare to bullet tains.Metro trains are quite similar to the bullet trains the major difference is metro trains are used to travel within inter city, where as bullet &amp;nbsp;trains can travel inter country within the less time. Primary goal of bullet trains is to reach the destination in less time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Main station of bullet trains should set up in major areas where people frequently travelled places. Regulation and Guidelines for the bullet trains have to be set up &amp;nbsp;by the government. start up of bullet trains needs huge investments which should be raised from the public by issuing equity, bonds, derivatives, partnership with other organisation will help governement to raise the funds for the start up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Difference between the normal trains and the bullet trains are: normal trains consume more time, It generates pollution in the environment, threat of robbary, Bomb blasts, Terrorism may occure.Bullet trains are fastest means of transportation, Time consumtion will be less, Comfortable, Arising threats will be less compare to normal trains.Bullet trains have to be set up in such a way that it can even move &amp;nbsp;on roads. Bullet trains should be automated that should reach and arrive in time which will remove the contrain of waiting time. Considering all the factors I prefer India needs a bullet trains to travel smoothly and fastly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
