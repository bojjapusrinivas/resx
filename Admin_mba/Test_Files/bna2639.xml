&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Plastic have become 90% indulged in everyday life.When it comes to the matter of its ban ,one should keep in mind the recovery and replacement of plastic before taking step.Earlier before plastic was discovered people survived but with things in other form say for example if we take plastic bags,earlier they used cloth bags instead of plastic .Compared to cloth palstic is low in cost but the harm that it causes to environment is beyond expected cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Plastic ban should be followed by every individual to cause no more harm to environment.Pollution free environment leads to healthy lives.Making of plastic includes chemicals that are mixed to mould and release pollution which&amp;nbsp;harm air and the water that`s used in making.Initially the plastic itself in the start is like one shot three birds - chemical mix in water and air that cause water pollution affecting marine life and air affecting all the lives on planet.Complete replacement of plastic&amp;nbsp; and ban of plastic from manufacturing are most beneficial ways from ones view to balance between economy and environment.Every individual has responsibility to save environment he lives in, that starts from the place he lives in and this applies to all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;There are incidents from which we can learn how to overcome a problem.The Currency Change in India,the aim of currency change was to stop corruption .But without taking proper steps orders were passed that harmed common citizens in various ways .Students faced problems with exams,marriages couldnt happen,journeys,food ,etc even the days were like one couldnt have food instead on having money with him .Cause : currency is banned.For plasctic ban all these factors should me considered that dont cause sufferings to community.Gathering of each and single drop leads to ocean.Soon small step taken to ban plastic can lead to plastic free environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
