Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, I agree with this making people aware is important, but more important is to convert awareness into action these are the sayings of the mahatma gandhi and it is implemented by our prime minister narendra modi. Clean india it is a slogan given by our prime minister narendra modi. The SWACH BHARAT program &amp;nbsp;was started by our Prime Minister NARENDRA MODI it is all about keeping the city clean and neat if the city is clean the country will be clean and if our country is clean our whole economy will be clean. the real meaning of swach bharat is to keep the city clean and neat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The most important thing is people themselves has to realize that their have to keep their surrounding clean and neat. any work should be done through whole heartedly than it lead to success. Its not the way if&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;think to keep the city clean, it should cme from our heart . The programme will be successful if the people feel it responsibility. Even now their are many villages, cities are not into the process of SWATCH BHARAT. Even though the government is taking many steps to implent the scheme completly bt still it is improper in our country. The government of india is taking many steps for the swatch bharat like it is offering the facility of door to door dustbin the main intentiom of this is to keep the surroundings clean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Our prime minister narendra modi has started this program many volunters are participated in this program to make it successful. Many ministers and MLA`s has taken part in this program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Firstly making people aware is important, but more important is to convert awareness in to action. by knowing the meaning of SWATCH BHARAT is not enough but the implementation is important . Even the small kids know the meaning of SWACH BHARAT but implementation is more important than knowing. The real change will come when people realize and follow it. Firstly the change should start from individual than it leads to whole world. The individual has to have minimum level of knowledge about the SWATCH BHARAT than it leads to success of these scheme. if the individual really mean that he should keep his surrounding clean than obivously it leads to success of the scheme. their are many benefits under this program lke keeping the city clean leads to healthy environment, good impression to foreigners, willing to implement some more new schemes by the government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Yes i agree with this &amp;nbsp;the attitude is more important than the movement the change in the individual attitude will the result of whole world. But to implement the SWACH BHARAT completely the government of india should take some more steps like it should keep some and regulations for the success of the program lke how the helment is mandatory for a person while driving to implement this the government has made a rule that the persons who are not wearing the helment there shold pay the fine of rs1000 like that government should make a certain rule that the persons who are not keeping the clean clean must be charged fine through this their may be some change. But even though the government is making rules the real change should come from the individual that he should keep his surroundings clean and neat than it leads to SWACH BHARAT. Whatever the change it should come from the individual rather than from the government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; But after the introduction of the SWACH BHARAT program there are some changes in our country but not completely still their are some cities, colony which are not following the program. Recentli the survey conducted by the government of india it is came to know that the U.P is in the first place regarding making the city clean and neat. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
