Do you think this brain drain is making the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer? Discuss the pros and cons of brain drain, and measures to check this phenomenon? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Countries that are developing and already had developed differs interms of economy growth,technology,Infrastructure&amp;nbsp;and employment.Developed countries like united states,united kingdom had good infrastructre,resources with latest technology and good employment oppurtunities which makes the work easier and efficient and that attracts the investors and qualified people ,that is one of the reasons which makes the qualified people and investors move to developed countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Qualified people in developing countries move to developed countries for higher studies,for better positions and some people to earn more money through working in reputed companies in a perception that they can lead better life in developed countries.people qualifying in developing countries like India and serving or applying their skills &amp;nbsp;in developed countries will definitely makes the rich countries more richer which inturn effects the developing countries.It`s like taking the advantage of education in home countries and indirectly being a part for making the poor countries poorer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Wat if all the well qualified people are working in developed countries and making the growth in economy of it?it definitely makes our economy weaker.working in home country and making ourself being a part of economy`s growth is very much important.Because people who got qualified in different sectors like IT,pharmacy,Defence,Infrastracture are applying their skills in other developed countries and making those sectors to grow.In this process developing countries are becoming weaker because of obsolete technology,poor health improvement strategies ,poor manpower and inadequate resources. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REASONS FOR MOVEMENT OF QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO DEVELOPED COUNTRIES:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Due to corruption in developing countries poor people are not getting oppurtunities for employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Lack of available resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Qualified education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For better payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I think all these drawbacks are to be overcomed to stop the qualified people from migrating to developed countries.Better politics can bring the change in economy growth by taking the advantage of foreign direct investment and by using resources properly developing countries can also attract the qualified people to work in home countries and develop the nation.Experts and qualified people plays the important role in developing the countries economy.so,we need to serve our country by applying our skills and that brings the value to our education. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:ChinaEconomicOutlookfo2013&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As the china`s growth rate was 7.8% in 2012 and it was the slowest growth rate in past 13 years,and &amp;nbsp;Li was &amp;nbsp;expecting the&amp;nbsp;gradual&amp;nbsp;increase in growth rate by reforming industralization,urbanization,improvements in agticultural productivity and investments in technology that can contribute to haelthy growth.And it would take some time to build the support necessary to implement such reforms.Increasing the production facilities and exports will help china to increase inflows and &amp;nbsp;overcome debt.presence of leverage in capital structure has the possibility of increase in &amp;nbsp;growth and to overcome risk as china is facing some risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cordial relationships with other countries :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Maintaining cordial relationships with other countries helps the country to take advantage of tehnical help and to attract FDI which,helps the vdevelopment of country`s infrastructure,technology and employment.And also reduction of tariffs in trading helps to take advantage of exports and imports which inturn develops the nation.It enables the free movement of goods.This will probably increase the growth rate of china in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Development of various sectors and reforming industrilization,urbanizatioin is tedious but acheiving that definiteky wilkl iuncrease the growth rate of china.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China &amp;ndash; Economic Outlook for 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fast can China grow? That is the question underlying much of the discussion about China&amp;rsquo;s economy these days. Clearly, double digit growth is not in the cards and may even be a thing of the past. Growth of 7.7 percent in the first quarter was considered disappointing, and, until recently, many analysts were expecting growth to revert to the range of 8&amp;ndash;9 percent. Yet now the government appears determined to reset expectations. The government has forecast that growth this year will be 7.5 percent, a good deal lower than many private analysts had forecast only recently. That is certainly slower than the 7.8 percent growth in 2012, which was the slowest rate of growth in 13 years. Premier Li Keqiang, in a recent speech in Germany, said that growth for the remainder of the decade will average an even lower 7.0 percent per year. Although far slower than the growth experienced during the past two decades, Li indicated that China is &amp;ldquo;entering a range of reasonable growth.&amp;rdquo; Given that China has become a more mature economy with a declining labor force, Li is probably correct in setting more modest expectations. Moreover, growth of 7.0 percent is not bad: It doubles the GDP in 10 years. Li said that a combination of industrialization, urbanization, improvements in agricultural productivity, and investments in technology can contribute to healthy growth, and that this requires more market-oriented reforms. He also said that &amp;ldquo;for a very big economy, this is not easy.&amp;rdquo; When and how such reforms will be implemented remains uncertain. While some reforms have been announced, many government statements have been relatively vague. With a new regime just installed, it could take some time to build the support necessary to implement much needed reforms. In the interim, China faces some risks, including the ramifications of large local government debt, considerable leverage in the shadow banking system, and weaker-than expected manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing weakness stems from weakness in export markets. In addition, rising wages in China are having an adverse impact on export competitiveness, thereby leading to an exodus of manufacturing capacity. Thus, even growth in the range of 7&amp;ndash;8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further global integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves China&amp;rsquo;s economic relationship with the rest of the world. China&amp;rsquo;s government now says it will study the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP), an effort to create a free-trade area in the Pacific Basin. Currently there are 12 countries involved in this effort: the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. If China joins the group, the TPP will collectively account for more than half of global GDP. Freer trade would entail not simply lowering tariffs and quotas, although this would be an important component. It would also involve freeing up domestic markets so that they would have to compete freely with foreign companies. From China&amp;rsquo;s perspective, this could be a positive development in that it would create pressure to privatize state-run companies, create a level playing field for the private sector, and allow free movement of prices of goods and credit. Still, agreement on the TPP is probably a long way off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
