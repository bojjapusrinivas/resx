Its tracks will be at the top of the road that is constructed by using pillers. By this, bullet trains, we can use road as usual without any distrubance of train tracks. In India many people use there own vehicles which causes lots of air pollution, noise pollution as well as traffic jams. By using bullet trains there is less pollution when compared with vehicles. Bullet trains are faster when compared with better trains. usually better trains are not be on time. people were not prefer to travel through trains because the trains are not be on time. Bullets trains are fast and there is lots of chances to the trains will be on time. In India,there is no sufficient trains for travelling. we can see there is a lot of rush in trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The bullet trains are better to travel in local areas. In other hand,the better trains are better to travel far palces.its better to improve the facilities in existing trains that is to provide more seats in trains. clean trains and maintains right time at right place. The more number of people do not know about the bullet trains. and they prefer to travel in better trains only. for that kind people we need to improve the trains. the more number of trains should be provide for far palces. The classes in trains should be remove because some people do not know about where to sit means in which class if they sit in first class bhogi then the railway people become annoy and they will insult the person who sit in first class unfortunately. In India, this kind of situations will happens in every day in every train. thats why its better to remove that classes.only one class should be provide for all class of people.this class sysytem critisizes the people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;By launching the bullet trains in india, the government can provide huge number of employment for all people i.e.,whether the people are educated or not.for uneducated people there is a low class jobs. and for educated people there is number of jobs. By this way india will overcome the problem of unemployment.the indian government increased cost of travelling in better trains and not only travelling cost it also increased the cost of platform ticket. by this charges people are not interested to travel in better trains.there will a reasonable cost for travelling. In bullet trains there will be no high cost for travelling when compared to better trains. people become smart now a days ,they prefer to use fastest way to reach their destiny. for maintaining the bullet trains we need to use new techniques and we need learn about the new technology which is useful for bullet trains. By using the technology, people came to know about the technolgy very well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullet trains looks smart than better trains. the stations were also looks clean and good. the bullet train station provides a eco friendly nature to the employees. it aslo provides a peaceful enviornment i.e,. there is no disturbance of train sounds. we can have bullet tarin stations near evey area by this way people can raech the station whenever they want to go anypalce locally. by using the technology, the bullet trains will be design smartly and provide many facilities like there will be a seats for senior citizens, special bhogis for women, seats at safe places for children, charging portals for mobile phones, laptops. the bullet trains should avoid the many people boarding into the train. the tickets should be sell for the number of seats available. bt this way we can avoid the huge number of people congestedly adjust in trains. There will be no classes for different kind of people. people likes to travel when trains have more facilities and availability of trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;finally my opinion, in india we need both bullet trains as well as better trains because people who go for far palces uses the trains which are provided by government . and uses bullet trains for local places. the government should also provide the bullet trains for far places because bullet trains are fast. in india we need to increase the number of trains than increase in prices. they should introduce many number of bullet trains and also provide the uses of those trains and the availability of those trains at places and their timings correctly. it should also provide the online &amp;nbsp;booking for tickets. and there information through online rather than going to the stations everytime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As coin has two sides, in the same way bullet trains have advantages as well as disadvantages also. there advantages are : fast, accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it will be on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;provide complete information through online. and people can not be suffer for congested trains and unavailability of trains at right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;disadvantages are: if there is no power when people need information through online there is no use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people who are do not know how to use the technology then the people won`t get bullet train services and the do not prefer to use bullet trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;the advantages of better trains are: many people prefer to use better trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people who are not knowing about technology also uses the better trains without facing any problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;disadvantages of better trains are: these trains are not available at right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;less number of trains are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people faces a lot of inconvience when there is non availbility of trains at right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the railways stations are also not near to many places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;the trains are very congested and women and children are facing lot of problem while get into better trains.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
