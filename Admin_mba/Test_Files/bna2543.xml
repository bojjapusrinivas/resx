&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cashless economy is about without cash,now a days it is so digitalized that many applications were used through technology to sell or buy the products in the market,making bank transactions through online investments in stock market ect are digitalized.The payments making through some applications like PAYTM,BOOKMYSHOW,MAKEMYTRIP etc...,by using this applications we can transfer money,make payments for booking movie tickets,travel all over INDIA,and for shopping purposes.All these was happening in digital way without using cash but by cards and applications.There are many digital cards like DEBIT CARD,CREDIT CARD,SMART CARD,SHOPPING CARDS etc...,we can use all these cards with some specifications, debit card is used to pay for online application forms, credit card also for shopping purpose without having a cash in the bank account it can be overdrawn,shopping card is used for shopping by getting star points we can shop all these happened through digital way.There are some programs conducted like make in INDIA,digital INDIA,ect...are useful that to develop our country more faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Digital way of payments through the latest and upcoming technologies is usefull to secure money through passwords and saving the data in the cloud softwares,cloud is used in many companies and also in banks for saving the&amp;nbsp; clients transactions and information.People won`t face&amp;nbsp; problems like robbing if the cash becomes digitalized.And can avoid carrying the bulk amount while traveling far places, by using credit and debit cards.There are many benifits if it is digitalized the economy can grow faster and country can developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Firstly the individual should know how to make payments in digitalized way but in such a case illiterate may not know all these things.security of cash cannot be perfect because there may be some server problems and the money can be lost if the amount is kept in some applications when it is uninstalled.If the person losts his credit or debit or mobile phones in such cases the complete amount saved in paytms will be gone and also it takes lots of time to get new credit and debit cards.Digitalized cash is not as much as good because any single mistake can cause the loss of data and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Global smart elevator market have the expectations to grow their business faster.It is driven by modernization of existing elevator systems.Main concept is how to develop the already existing product by using modern technologies.It is decided to develop and add more features to that elevator with smart way with in the developing Asian countries, by 2020.China itself offers 53 percent of upcoming projects in the world,then this business will be more helpfull and make projects with them.This business should think that the elevator has a glassed door to view the outside environment. By planting small trees and greenary&amp;nbsp; surroundings&amp;nbsp; to the elevator it looks attractive and pleasant by&amp;nbsp; watching from the elevator.There are some contributors through out the world from U.S.,U.K,Canada,and France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technologically with some good features and also this elavator is provided in commercial,healthcare,corporate companies etc.., it is used and also by guiding features to reach the destination with a comfortable way.Because of&amp;nbsp; growing population in our country this efficient elevators might be usefull in public places and also we can see it everywhere nowadays.It is also useful for dispatching&amp;nbsp; heavy goods through elevator safely and also used in many work stations.The cloud systems also used to save the data without any discripancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevator market would proove a great start for the overall market.This elevators used for offices,hotels,financial institutions,shopping malls etc..,there is also different concepts used by building elevator in different places.Elevators consume more power so by using innovative solutions they can reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 with a concept of energy reduction approximately up to 10%.so this smart technology should focus different from that company and maximize the power reduction than that company.Then this will become usefull and marketed easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
