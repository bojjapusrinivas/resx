Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Clean India" is more essential factor now days in India &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Swatch Bharath" is the programe which was introduced by our &amp;nbsp;prime minister Narendra Modi recently in India.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modi gave &amp;nbsp;speeches in the meetings about clean India, how people have to make there surroundings clean and green. Every one are cleaning there houses and they are dumping the &amp;nbsp;dust on road sides,this is not a good thing to do, they &amp;nbsp;have to dump the dust in the dust bins which are providing by our goventment. we are responsible for our home, our surroundings,our street,our city,our state,our country. Every one are responsible to keep our surroundings clean and green. Parents have to give awareness about the Clean India program to there children,they have to teach there children about how to make our surroundings clean and green.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In schools and colleges &amp;nbsp;it is the responsiblity of the teachers to give &amp;nbsp;instructions about the "Clean India",because childrens starts learning from the schools,how to behave, how to respect the elders so the teachers have to guide the students to keep there surroundings good,they have to start the cleaning programs in schools by giving instrusctions like... the childrens have to dump there waste papers, waste wrapers etc in to the dust bins. This is the age where children learn,so teachers have to concentrate on the Clean India program at schools. If they learn in the schools how to clean our surroundings automatically they do outside the school also.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every citizen in India have the responsibilty to clean our home as well as our surroundings. Telling some one to not to dump on the roads, beside our homes and bring awareness among the people by giving the speeches by gathering the people. Mostly in villages many people are still not using the washrooms they are going out side the homes,this is not good they have to build the washrooms for every home and they have to use them. There are many associations or welfare groups they have to go to the villages and they have to bring awareness to the people in the villages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government is also ready to help the uneducated &amp;nbsp;people in the villages to know about the clean India. One educated student or a person can tell to many other ones about the clean India. Making people aware is not only important, but also it is more important to convert awareness into action. Converting into action is not an easy task to everyone, they have to selfmotivate by there own and they have to put it into action. By cleaning our home and our surroundings which helps us for a healthy life. If we found any dust on the roads we have to clean it without any hesitation,this shows how we are intrested in our city.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
