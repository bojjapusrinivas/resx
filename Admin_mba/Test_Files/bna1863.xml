Do you think this brain drain is making the rich countries richer and poor countries poorer? Discuss the pros and cons of brain drain, and measures to check this phenomenon? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Now-a-day qualified people are looking jobs in well developed or rich countries for the better position ,money etc .Well come in to developing countries india`s half of the countries population`s are working for other countries.Till us see on the bases of survey take in India ,come into southern states we find more than half of bthe population from andhra and telagana are working in U.S.A, AUSTRLIA and many other places in world and from northern states it is more than half of the population.Many students after finishing their graduation they will trying for going aborad for their post graduation courses like mba,m.s,hotel mangement ,research etc.In well developed countries many of them are INDIAN working for many organisation and working to make more developed .many qualified students or employees are searching for jobs in developed because of job position,work stress,money and lot more.see in developing countries many of the &amp;nbsp;developed countries organisation are opening their branches in INDIA,because of labour cost,land cost etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Using the brain of qualified people from the developing countries, the developed countries are getting use of that.it is causing many diificulties to the developing countries.For developing countries like india it is the huge loss for the well been of the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Let`s talk on the basis of qualified graduates in the developing countries,many of them will look of the jobs in a better postion in their country;but the problem is the salary packages that the company is prodiving for themwhose &amp;nbsp;having good qualification.on the other way &amp;nbsp;qualified graduates from foreign countries are getting good jobs and salary packages in both developed and developing country.so many of the students go to foreign countries for completing the post graduation degree from university ome of the advantage is that thier get work experience when their on studying itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;My opinion is that it is causing &amp;nbsp;a huge loss for the developing countries.because it is helping the developed countries to grow richer and richer coming into developing countries it is making poorer and poorer.in developing countries like india it is having a huge impact on the countries development such as industrialization,investments,productivity,manufacturing and lot more.so both the governments(central and state) had to start to over come such difficulties.our prime minister of india has introduced" make in india" that may be helpful for both the developiung and developed countries.the measures to over come this phenomenon is that provide the better jobs for the qualified people in the developing countries ,if not till will be the huge loss for the developing countries.if not the poorer countries become more poorer,and the developed countries will become more richer if this sitution goes on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China &amp;ndash; Economic Outlook for 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fast can China grow? That is the question underlying much of the discussion about China&amp;rsquo;s economy these days. Clearly, double digit growth is not in the cards and may even be a thing of the past. Growth of 7.7 percent in the first quarter was considered disappointing, and, until recently, many analysts were expecting growth to revert to the range of 8&amp;ndash;9 percent. Yet now the government appears determined to reset expectations. The government has forecast that growth this year will be 7.5 percent, a good deal lower than many private analysts had forecast only recently. That is certainly slower than the 7.8 percent growth in 2012, which was the slowest rate of growth in 13 years. Premier Li Keqiang, in a recent speech in Germany, said that growth for the remainder of the decade will average an even lower 7.0 percent per year. Although far slower than the growth experienced during the past two decades, Li indicated that China is &amp;ldquo;entering a range of reasonable growth.&amp;rdquo; Given that China has become a more mature economy with a declining labor force, Li is probably correct in setting more modest expectations. Moreover, growth of 7.0 percent is not bad: It doubles the GDP in 10 years. Li said that a combination of industrialization, urbanization, improvements in agricultural productivity, and investments in technology can contribute to healthy growth, and that this requires more market-oriented reforms. He also said that &amp;ldquo;for a very big economy, this is not easy.&amp;rdquo; When and how such reforms will be implemented remains uncertain. While some reforms have been announced, many government statements have been relatively vague. With a new regime just installed, it could take some time to build the support necessary to implement much needed reforms. In the interim, China faces some risks, including the ramifications of large local government debt, considerable leverage in the shadow banking system, and weaker-than expected manufacturing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing weakness stems from weakness in export markets. In addition, rising wages in China are having an adverse impact on export competitiveness, thereby leading to an exodus of manufacturing capacity. Thus, even growth in the range of 7&amp;ndash;8 percent cannot be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further global integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of change involves China&amp;rsquo;s economic relationship with the rest of the world. China&amp;rsquo;s government now says it will study the possibility of joining the Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP), an effort to create a free-trade area in the Pacific Basin. Currently there are 12 countries involved in this effort: the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, and New Zealand. If China joins the group, the TPP will collectively account for more than half of global GDP. Freer trade would entail not simply lowering tariffs and quotas, although this would be an important component. It would also involve freeing up domestic markets so that they would have to compete freely with foreign companies. From China&amp;rsquo;s perspective, this could be a positive development in that it would create pressure to privatize state-run companies, create a level playing field for the private sector, and allow free movement of prices of goods and credit. Still, agreement on the TPP is probably a long way off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
