<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3/11/2016 11:54:09 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To inculcate the spirit on entrepreneurship in India, the Government launched &amp;lsquo;Start-up India&amp;rsquo; initiative in January 2016. Do you think this initiative would be a historic moment in ushering the era of economic prosperity in India. Please elaborate with reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Government has taken a good initiative. These days the problem of unemploymebt exists. To overcome this problem `start-up India` is agood boon. Entreprenurship is a skill that has to inculcated in the people through Entreprenuerial Development Programmes. Skills on time management, networking with people (i,e) stakeholders. Entrepreurs are successful only when they expand their network, have good relationships with the service providers like dealers of raw materials, Creditor`s, people working in the same field, Logisticians, wide reach to the customers situated in different locations, excellent market strategies, etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Government launched the initiative and they also said that there are many exceptions on tax and no need of collateral security for granting of loan. The people who are ready to take this chance of excelling in it have to come up with Innovative idea`s that are feasible and can reap profits. Ringging Bells is the recent example that promised a smartphone Freedom 251 at rs 251, plus delivery chareges of rs 40. The problem arose at the time of fulfilling the promise, there were about 6 crore orders placed and it was not feasible by the firm to manufacture and fullfil the promise made.Therefore it is very important to be prepared for the negative outcomes and have an other back up plan or any other alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;If people are taught about Entrepreurship in the colleges and schools and practically dedicate few days on implementation and conduct workshop`s on it, it may inculcate the interest and passion in the students. In our country there are many skilled people and there are people with lot`s of hidden talents. If they attend classes or workshops they may understand there passion and make use of the provided facilities and make use of the different plans brought by the Govenment. The problem of unemployment will be eraduacted as the Entrepreneur provides employment to many other people and the capital, investment in machinery is also less. There will be a better and prospering India in terms of increase in the GDP, NI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the modernization of the existing elevator systems, it is expected that the revenue generation will increase rapidly. The services will be provided at a faster pace, comport driven and secured enough. Due to advancement in the feaures of technology used the supply of information, access control and security the smart elevators serve the needs of various segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality.It is customizable with&amp;nbsp;excellent reliability, hygine, aesthetics, ride and destination control. It is spacious and comfortable to the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;As there is a tremendous increase in the migration of people to cities there will be a vertical growth. This is expected in U.S., Canada, France and Asian countries. Thyssenkrupp, Schindler Elevator are leading corporations engaged in these buiness. Examples of the applications of the smart elevators are The Hearst Tower, Bank of America in Manhattan, the HUmana headquartes in louisville, Crescent in Dallas, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
