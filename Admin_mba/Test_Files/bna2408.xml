Thus railways are given prior importance in annual budget of country ,earlier there was a seperate budget for railways now it got integrated with general budget. Indian railways run two types of &amp;nbsp;train segments i.e; one segment for goods carrier and other for passengers.The govt also balances between two segments in budget allocation, new railway lines etc. As the population of country is nearly 121 crores ,the problem of conggestion comes into picture that causes inconvenience to passengers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; There are many reasons for the inconvenience for passengers ,they are number of seats availability , timliness of trains arraival &amp;amp; departure, wash rooms maintenence, fear from chain snachers, less allocation of seats for physically handicapped people, less allocation of ladies compartment, poor anouncement of special trains during festive seasons etc. All these &amp;nbsp;problems are &amp;nbsp;need to be addressed to deliver satisfactory service to passengers. Before addressing the problems the scheduling of trains must be properly handled i.e; the superfast ,the express trains , the passenger trains must be scheduled properly for passenger benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Now-a-days bullet trains are more prevalent in foreign countries like US, UK, Japan ,Russia , etc; Those trains were introduced in &amp;nbsp;such away that it reduces time of travel, luxury ,comfortability and avoids mismanagement of time by passengers.The fare for bullet trains is very high when we compare with normal trains. thus these trains are targetted at niche segment in society i.e; who were rich and above middle class. The population of the above mentioned countries is less when compared with India and it is also one factor for smoothn running of bullet trains.But coming to our neighbouring country Chaina it`s to running bullet trains in certain locations by considering all demographic factors like age ,population size, gender ,income levels etc .It &amp;nbsp;is successful in running bullet trains though it is worlds most populated country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; While coming to India ,it is having a unique feature i.e; unity in diversity.There are different group of people staying in different parts of the country .The income levels of the people were not one and the same.The people here were categorised into five levels they are rich people, above middle class, middle class, below middle class and poor people.The people from the top two categeories they can afford to travel by bullet train segment where as coming to in between two classes they can afford to travel by superfast, express . At last poor people can afford to travel by express and paassenger segment. thus from above majority of people are used to travel by normal trains rather than bullet trains. Thus India need to concentrate more on better trains because they cover major portion of total population . But on the other side the government need to concentrate on introduction of bullet trains that serves the &amp;nbsp;business class (rich people) who contribute major portion of governments revenue exchequer.Introduction of bullet trains is not a small task it involves huge investments thus FDI`s need to be allowed in railways.With introduction of bullet trains country can meet certain criterias for selecting in top world class countries Which were ranked by some agencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Finally India needs to more concentrate on better trains and start a move towards introduction of bullet trains gradually in certain locations as similar with chaina. Thus one day or other India would become super power with inclusion of top &amp;nbsp;infrastructural facilities i.e; bullet trains innovative technolgy etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
