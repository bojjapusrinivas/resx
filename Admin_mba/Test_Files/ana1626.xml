<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;7/24/2014 4:03:51 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For India to progress, do we really need smaller states? What has been the performance of small states that were carved out previously from large states? Have they fulfilled the demands of the people or is it just plain power politics at play?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;DEVELOPED&amp;nbsp; OR DEVELOPING&amp;quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2"&gt;That is the question that has been hovering the minds of many Indians throughout ages. Can the government and the esteemed political family of India answer us.Well, the common answer any person would give for the above question is India is still&amp;nbsp;a developing country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Common man has lost his trust in the government and feels that no matter whom he votes nothing will change the fate of the country. People have a strong &amp;nbsp;feeling that a political party would do anything to win the elections and post to it would make&amp;nbsp;a hundred excuses to fulfil their promises.&amp;nbsp;Now the question here is will India ever come out of this phase, will the political parties learn to show a level of transparency to the citizens and be termed as a progressing and a developing country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2"&gt;Going back in the memory lane, the burning issue a year ago was the Telangana saga. Countless protests, hunger strikes and agitation by the student groups was initiated in order to achieve a new and an&amp;nbsp;independent state. Many protestors&amp;nbsp;who were mostly young students lost their valuable lives. What was the reason behind all this, what made people believe that their lives would be changed. The leader who started this entire process promised people that they would&amp;nbsp;have better lives and their children would have a great future. People instilled their faith&amp;nbsp;in him and&amp;nbsp; got involved in the movement. On the other hand the opposing parties wanted a united state. The stage was all set for a political drama and the same happened. Finally, the central government had to put their hands&amp;nbsp;up and declare an independent state named Telangana. There are many such states in the country which have been divided in the past. Will this continue in the country in years to come. Will India be divided into a number of smaller states. This will remain an unanswered question.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2"&gt;As a young citizen of this country I have my own views and opinions regarding this issue. Rather than&amp;nbsp;starting protests for a separate state, let our leaders take up issues that the common man face in day-to-day life. Are we not surrounded by a million issues such as corruption, rape, woman empowerment etc. There have been&amp;nbsp;a number of rape cases in the previous year. Can any of our concerned leaders tell us the status of these rape cases. Let us start abolishing such incidents from the society. Our country needs a&amp;nbsp;major change.We need dynamic people who can lead us and&amp;nbsp;whom we can relate to.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The political leaders have to realise the fact that practicality is more important that being theoretical. We need leaders who can uplift the face of India in the global map. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="trebuchet ms,geneva" size="2"&gt;During our school days we have learnt &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;UNITY IN DIVERSITY&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;No matter how many states we get divided into we need to represent ourselves as a&amp;nbsp;developed united nation. A nation that has a zeal to empower, to learn and to excel.We need leaders who can are willing to achieve the status of a developed&amp;nbsp; nation.&amp;nbsp;Lets start abiding in the values of democracy, secularism and fundamentalism.&amp;nbsp;We call ourselves as a country which is for the people, by the people and off the people.Not only the leaders&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;even we need to become responsible citizens. Lets build up a new nation and lets make India a developed nation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
