&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;Introduction&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Bullet trains are used in the metro cities to reduce the travelling time. As India being devveloping country the standard of living of the people and the neccessities of the people are also increasing.More number of people are being literates when compared to past and the mail transport which is used by them are trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="underline"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;Supportive points or factors considered to choose bullet trains instead of better trains are&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The trains which India needs is bullet trains instead of better trains. In india the railway system is controlled by the government and the problems of the passengers and trains are addressed by the railway department.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;India needs bullet trains instead of better trains beacuse now-a-days more number of people are using trains to travel arround. The usage of local trains are increased in metro areas.Better trains are needed becuase the trains which are used in local areas are the trains of which service is completed. Inter-state trains are also has many problems regarding hygine, puntuality. The bullet trains are also needed but more than the &amp;nbsp;better and safest trains are needed. The major reasons for this &amp;nbsp;trains are the very first thing is service which is provided to the passengers in the trains. services include each and everything which the passenger may need from the railway department. The second reason is Punctuality. If the trains come in time then we donot need any speed or bullet trains. The timings of the trains are not maintained properly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In India bullet trains are not much popular. In Japan, Singapore where the bullet trains are very popular. But the people in metro cities or areas are more likely to travel in the Bullet trains to reach their destination fastly and safely. As India being a developing country the neccessities of the &amp;nbsp;people are also increasing. The standard of living in India is also increasing. The more number of people are now literates when compared to past. People now-a-days choosing trains as their main transport instead of bus to travel within the city.Buses are less considered becuase traffic is increasing these days. The metro trains are very popular in metro cities. Local trains are replacing with metro trains in many areas. Presently in telangana state the metro area where the more number people are travelling within the area is hyderabad. In hyderabad local trains are being used by the people since so many years but the usage of trains are increased and the people need speed trains in the present life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Now-a-days people likely to be perfer bullet trains becuase the more time is being consumed in travelling. If we use bullet trains instead of normal or local trains the time which is consumed in &amp;nbsp;travelling is saved and we can use that time for other purposes. If we replace the normal trains with bullet trains we generate more revenue to the government and the number trips of that particular train are also increases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In India budget for the railways are considered very important. The central government provide huge ammount in the form of buget to the railways to increase their services and also increase the usage of trains. The ammount which is used for the development of railways are being properly utilised. The railway authority is taken care of the services which are to be provided to the passengers. THe major part why the people choose train as their means of transport is to reduce thier travelling time. if the normal trains are replaced with the bullet trains then the time for travelling is been reduced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Conclusion: Finally, i would like to conclude the given topic "Bullet trains or better trains-what does India needs?" by giving my opinion that bullet trains are needed by India instead of better trains in fast moving generation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
