Do developed countries have a higher obligation to combat climate change than developing countries? Discuss in detail.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global warming now a days has become a big problem for people in different countries accross the globe. &amp;nbsp;Every human being is reponsible for global warming.People in different countries talks about global warming but no one really cares about their own country. people are concentrationg/Focusing more on earning money and contributes very less &amp;nbsp;towards &amp;nbsp;social activities. In developed countries like U.S, U.K, France, People understands what is the first priority towards the country. They maintain cleanliness in order to keep the city clean and hygine. Education has been given less importance and employment is more in developing countries which leads to global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In developing countries, these aspects are not been concentrated and maintained which causes global warming. Especially in rural areas in developing countries. Developed countries does`nt have much obligation due to the above reasons. uses of Industries which forms gases will change the climate and environment becomes harmfull. people die due to this climate and this is seen more in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by all these things we can say that developed countries would not have obligation to combat climate change because developed countries are surrounded by high technology instruments which donot lead to suffer people due to climate compared to developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart Elevator Market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart Elevators are now a days booming in market and is expected to grow globally. Asian countries are expected to experience smart elevators for their delevopment. China is highest in percentage of the contribution for the project around the world. However, the demand for fast and comfortable transportation system have been raising and the major contributors who are the developed countries such as U.S, U.K, France and Canada &amp;nbsp;has contributed revenue to expand the market of smart elevators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-rise buildings are expected to adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems which would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute high percentage of revenue for smart elevator market. Smart elevators can be a great contribution towards the end use segments such as residential, healthcare, hospitality as well as commercial which can provide reliability, hygiene, space and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data, there is a change seen in the cities wherein the&amp;nbsp;percentage of&amp;nbsp;urban population were accounted more than the world`s overall population in 1960. Every year, the world`s population increases by 1.8% and the expansion of cities result in growth which leads to high rise projects. The higher the demand, the higher the supply for smart elevators. Among these, Thyssenkrupp who maintains and manages the elevators has now using cloud system which now a days used by &amp;nbsp;big corporates and others in order to collect data which is useful to gather valuable data to maintain the service of elevators. Schindler elevator corporation has successfully completed the installation in 2014 and&amp;nbsp;alsomodernized PORT elevator technology in Puerto Rico and also in &amp;nbsp;some of the buildings like Crscentand Humana.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercial uses of the smart elevators which are used by offices, hotels, hospitals, Multiplexes and other financial institutions concentrates on the design and capacity of the elevators according to the passengers in different areas. for Example, hospitals concentrates on deeper elevators, Multiplexes concentrates on Vandal proof elevators whereas, ride comfort elevators are used by warehouses and in retail sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to its efficiency and consumption, Elevators has large amount of energy consuming level especially the elevators which are used by the commercial buildings according to the traffic.In addition to this, Smart elevators are user friendly &amp;nbsp;compared to other elevators in the market which gives the same experience in less power consuming. &amp;nbsp;Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator which comes under the smart technology in the year 2011 which is again user friendly and less consuming upto 10% which is &amp;nbsp;a great contribution towards the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
