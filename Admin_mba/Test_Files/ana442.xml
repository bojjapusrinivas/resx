Elaborate with facts. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indian economy &amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;has a huge potential to become the next economic superpower. Which is quite obvious from&amp;nbsp; foreign investors queuing up, &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp; showing interest in setting up shops here.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India is the second&amp;nbsp; largest&amp;nbsp;country in terms of population&amp;nbsp;in the world, which creates a huge market for&amp;nbsp; many business. Our population , in numbers is only second to China, which almost has reached a saturation point, consumerism reaching its peak, it becomes difficult for business to&amp;nbsp;grow further&amp;nbsp;or invest more.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;On the other hand markets in western countries, developed countries also ,have reached a saturation point in terms of consumersim,&amp;nbsp;and with the population growth rate steadily falling down in many European country&amp;#39;s , growth opportunity&amp;#39;s would be fewer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Contrary to these conditions Indian market is failry un exploited, being a late entrant into the Global market , India remained closed for a long period to the western business, technology and so on.With the opening of entry restricitions to western business, India has entered the fray for being the economic superpower, Fighting for&amp;nbsp;it&amp;#39;s share &amp;nbsp;in the world market.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;If we were to draw a comparision between the existing super power America and any other country that is in a position or dreams to be the next super power, India has an edge over other Country&amp;#39;s in more than one way.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;India&amp;#39;s &amp;nbsp;having a huge population (that creates a big market)&amp;nbsp;aside,&amp;nbsp;it is highly unexploited. we are culturally as diverse as any other country or even more , a culturally diverse society brings in new ideas, new life styles , and new technologies which helps in creating an economic force.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;India by itself,&amp;nbsp;is highly&amp;nbsp;diverse, a diverse society creates&amp;nbsp;diverse markets and many business.Opportunites exists in every sector.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We are more accessible to the world markets in terms of culture compatibility, so to say, and language plays an importnant role as such&amp;nbsp;. India is in a better position than China, Brazil or Russia , as we almost have english as medium for most of our business transactions, that makes our markets more accessible&amp;nbsp;to the existing super power, which brings in a huge share of business, new and old into this country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;India has a huge pool of man power resources, that is highly educated, talented and flexible. Indian professionals have moved to different parts of the world, when markets were closed here, but with the opening of Indian markets and many business coming up, the need for such professionals has risen within the country. Now Indian professionals can work within the country, close to their families, and Indian talents, brains can be used towards solving domestic problems, who understand the people , and their problems here, in a better way.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Ever since Indian markets were thrown open, the growth rate has been steady, but not at a very fast pace as one would have expected, as we still are torn between domestic and foreign issues and culture ,but as time passes by, we understand the importance of working with different cultures and the good it does to us, like in case of the wal mart issue there is still a strong resistence, there are many such areas where we still need to make agressive pitches and invite and attract more foreign and encourage local businessmen to get into.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Though Indian markets were open , to both foreign and domestic players like easing up of quota system for local business and entry of global competitors for foreign players, the number of industry &amp;amp; business &amp;nbsp;that have become active and contributed to the economy is not huge. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As we can see&amp;nbsp;, a major contibutor to the economy thus far has been services, for example, IT &amp;amp; technology services have contributed heavily, media to an extent. But many major industry&amp;#39;s still havent explored India for example retail though catching up , hasnt made the kind of progress we would have wanted it to which eventually would&amp;nbsp; happen in the years to come, education,manufacturing, health services,agriculture to name a few could spur a major economic boom in the country&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspite of many other business falling behind, there is already a huge expectation with the way existing players are performing, that Indian economy has every reason to dream of becoming the next economic super power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
