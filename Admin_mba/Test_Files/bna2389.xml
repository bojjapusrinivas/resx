&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;INDIA is one most developing countries in the world.INDIA is the one of most powerful country in the world. The country consists of over 120 crore population. In recent survey`s result, INDIA is in the top position which is containing young blood in majority of its population. INDIA is one of the best place to invest and establish companies. Many states in INDIA are practicing SINGLE WINDOW SYSTEM for approval of new companies registration. INDIA GDP RATE is increased to 6.90. INDIA TRANSPORTS its goods via roadways and railways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;INDIAN RAILWAYS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;INDIAN RAILWAYS is the major transport facility where crores of people in india are able able to travel from source to their destination. INDIAN RAILWAYS serves the nation as a transport facility for the passengers as well as a SOURCE FOR MOVING GOODS from one place to another. INDIAN &amp;nbsp;RAILWAYS is most important source for the country where it was given huge importance.We can see that INDIAN RAILWAYS was placed under a RAILWAY MINISTRY where a minister is assigned to control the INDIAN RAILWAYS department. There used to conduct seperate budget session in PARLIAMENT for INDIAN RAILWAYS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;BULLET TRAINS OR BETTER TRAINS ?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;INDIAN RAILWAYS is one of the oldest and largest railways which has railway lines in thousands of kms. But INDIAN RAILWAYS lacks in development of TRAINS which its using for passenger transport. Mostly INDIAN TRAINS are equipped with a outdated engines where the engine top speed doesn`t exceed 100km/hr. In countries like china,japan TRAINS are upgraded to latest technology where their engines top above 400km/hr. Finally INDIAN RAILWAYS DEPARTMENT took a step to introduce BULLET TRAINS in its lineup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;WHAT DOES INDIA NEED ?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;INDIA need bullet trains as well as better trains. BULLET TRAINS are needed for the people who travels long distance across INDIA. People are spending days to travel long distance across the country. To reduce the time consumption of the TRAIN to travel,bullet trains are needed. Let us take an example, TELANGANA SUPER FAST EXPRESS from SECUNDERABAD TO NEW DELHI, it takes more than one day to travel from source to destination. Despite of being one of the top speed trains in INDIAN RAILWAYS, it still consumes lots of time to complete the journey. So INDIA need BULLET TRAINS to reduce the time consumption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;PROS OF BULLET TRAINS IN INDIA:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT in trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;TECHNOLOGY USAGE in railway staion and railway lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;NEW AND IMPROVED trains, railway lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;REDUCED TIME consumption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;BETTER TRAVELLING experience for passengers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;PROBLEMS OF &amp;nbsp;BULLET TRAINS IN INDIA:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Though bullet trains are benificial to the PASSENGERS and INDIAN RAILWAYS it involves some problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;PRESENT RAILWAY LINE doesn`t support the BULLET TRAINS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;There will be a huge time lapse to UPGRADE RAILWAY LINES as the area that have to be covered is large.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;ACCIDENTS may occur as the INDIAN RAILWAYS have no protection for &amp;nbsp;railway gates due to increased speed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;There is a need in skill development for the employees to handle BULLET TRAINS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"&gt;NEED FOR BETTER TRAINS :&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"&gt;INDIA need speed trains but it lacks to fulfill basic requirements to run the TRAINS.INDIA is still using the OBSELETE TRAINS &amp;nbsp;where the compartments are not fit for use. INDIAN RAILWAYS OPERATIONS are still manual in many places and the TRAINS are still not upgraded and OBSELETE &amp;nbsp;that are not safe to travel. As we discussed INDIAN RAILWAYS lack speed but we must take safety in our consideration. SERVICES offered in ordinary trains and special trains like GARIBRADH EXPRESS differs, but there lacks basic needs in TRAINS. As we can see many trains are OVERCROWDED but still INDIAN RAILWAYS SELLS THE TICKETS TO PASSENGERS. Though railway department are aware of the OVERCROWDED TRAINS it doesnt increase the number of compartments for the passengers. There are many issues that are existing in INDIAN RAILWAYS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;YES, INDIAN TRAINS MUST PROVIDE BETTER TRAINS FOR THE PASSENGERS AS NOT ALL THE PASSENGERS NEEDED BULLET TRAINS BUT NEEDED A BETTER TRAIN WHICH CAN FULFILL BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE PASSENGERS.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;INDIA need BULLET TRAINS to cover its largest area in less time and INDIA also need BETTER TRAINS which can satisfy the BASIC REQUIREMENTS of the PASSENGERS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
