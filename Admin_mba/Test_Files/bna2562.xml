Discuss three key factors for making `Make in India` a reality.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In India, there are many products manufactured. As our prime minister has started the MAKE IN INDIA it will be very useful for many people and in many ways . If we discuss about the making India as a manufacturing hub that would be very greatful and it would help out to develop India .There are few manufacturing products which are manufactured in India. As there are many facilities such as technology ,innovative ideas, experienced people .a product can make out&amp;nbsp; with the help of technology,research,innovative ideas etc..&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many new innovative ideas which are continuing in India such as food trucks , gadgets etc are mostly invented by the Indians. As the time passes there are many new ideas getting explored by the people who are experienced. Day by day the technolgy as getting improved and with the help of the scholars or the innovatiors there is huge develpment for the manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If i get an opportunity I would explore my innovative ideas to create a product which would make out the good response in the marekt environment. Make in India is a good opportunity giving to explore the ideas of the innoavtors .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product should be in such a way that it should be useful and worthful to the people .After the products gets manufactured their should be a proper innovative ideas to advertise and to make out a proper well knowing to the public. Product should be manufactured within the India and that would be market in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Making India a manufacturibg hub gives much benifits to the people who are needy.This helps the innoavtors in the best way to prove there ideas to explore and they will have an opportunity to manufacture there product in india itself. Becasue if the Indian`s are blessed with the great ideas to manufacture the product if the process is develeoped by the othercountries that would give much profits .&amp;nbsp; If the innvator comes out with the idea if he has a perfect knowledge and experience to process the product to make a final product that gives much experience , profits ,reputation and many more .. That would develop India into great postion. For eg: If we take MAGGI , this product was started in India it was started many years ago but till the date it is standing in a good postion with huge profits , reputation. like wise if the product would be created or manufactured within the India then India will be standing in the top postion . Can make INDIA AS A MANUFACTURING HUB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufactures should have knowledge , creative ideas, financial support, government support ,technology,smart workers etc . So, that the manufacturers can easily develop their ideas and can easily make India as a MANUFACTURING HUB.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is getting develeoped as the technology getting improved the ideas and the innovations have explored . In few developed countries like North America ,Europe and East Asia, markets are getting improved and developed . vendors are enjoying their business and fulfilling the customer satistfaction .As the countries are emerging for the enterprise smart grid to develop there business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there are dozens of vendors to increase there business and to satisfy their needs and the customer satsisfaction. The vendosrs should be updated with the reviews of there product and should try for the improments and chnages to be made .&amp;nbsp; As we have seen in above para that there are many vendors with merging , acusitions . partnerships these are to develop there enterprise.This would take time and hard work but deffinatelty it gets succesed in future because as the people are getting very bsuy in there day to day busy schedule they are neede for the smart products .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market- An Insight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; Brazil is one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid develpment. Brazil stands in the top most postion as the country is moving foward in themarket compared to other countries .It dosent have much failures or losses inase if they face any of the loss they are well protected with the smart meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;As the study describes that Brazil is the fastest developed country in market that would help out the smart grids to get into success. with the good fame in the society gives the motivavtion and can develop get into success. smart grids vendors can achieve there goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the vendors try to improve more and more they will get into success for sure. because if there are updates in any of the data or the changes in the products that will help out the vendors to reach there goals.&amp;nbsp; it may take time to lead there postion but there should be a help to be taken with technology , smart workers, innovators. Both vendors and customers should be satisfied then only the enterprise or the smart grid will get into successed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To develop the more market value Brazil market should run much better than the previous with few improvements so that the country which has been merged that is Brazil stands in the top postion further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms. With high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors and smaller, more fragmented local players will help shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. This study takes a comprehensive look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positioning themselves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across all regions of the world, highlights growing regions and market segments, and assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions that are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries, smart grid investment will reach $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. This study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of the hundreds of vendors competing for this growing market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market &amp;ndash; An Insight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development. With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action. Like many emerging market countries, Brazil has high rates of non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also has a rapidly growing economy, which is beginning to strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it&amp;nbsp; set a non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However,&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; August&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2012, the&amp;nbsp; government&amp;nbsp; announced&amp;nbsp; an&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;opt--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;in&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meter&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; regulation&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; customers,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Paired with&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; requiring&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; new&amp;nbsp; customers.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp; was&amp;nbsp; not&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; anticipated&amp;nbsp; market&amp;nbsp; catalyst&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; those&amp;nbsp; expecting&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; binding&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; replace&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million existing legacy&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; result,&amp;nbsp; Northeast&amp;nbsp; Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its initial 63 million smart meter target. Yet, some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be achieved, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;With strong underlying economic and political conditions, it is inevitable that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade. The question is simply how fast deployments will take place. Through a combination of new meter installations, smart meters targeted at reducing non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt; technical losses, and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications, more than half of Brazilian homes will have smart meters by the end of the decade. However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
