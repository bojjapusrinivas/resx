&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullet train and Better train these 2 trains which used to give service to public where they can reach there destination safely in time&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullet train which is used or fastest journey whenever there is a urgency or emergency we can use these train .They are used only for the sitting purpose night time journey is not comfortable with these bullet trains only in some bullet trains that facility is available and in our country they are not introduced at because there is no breth to sleep or to take rest .while coming to better trains which is affordable to any kind of people for any place at any time they can do their journey by enjoying with their families and if there is any emergency or any issue happend then we can pull the chain or they can use emergency exit .Bullet trains are used for less journey destination where they can be in time in our state the new &amp;nbsp;government has have many schemes and job in railways and they had increased the charges where the poor people are unable to go to any other places when they want to go.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to me both trains are important by seeing those many situations where the people are going to face they problems and in past and main train accidents occur due to the neglegence of the employees and the drivers in the train where they are unable to manage them so in that case to overcome those problems we can go with the bullet trains and overcome the accidents to some extent &amp;nbsp;for this bullet trains are used.e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to the government estimation in future there will be no coal before facing that problem we can introduce the bullet trains and overcome them with many facilities and they can arrange some changes and there should be no parciality between the men and women and everyone should be treated &amp;nbsp;as same in providing opportunities and they can also plan for &amp;nbsp;some trains where there are no trains in some areas and they can introduce the better trains which are affordable to them to travel from one place to another to reach there destination.both these trains can be used because bullet trains can be introduced but all old better trains cannot be replaced with it slowly we can change our developing country to the developed country by making some changes in our government as well as in our aspects and these bullet trains are mostly used for the foreginers where they can feel comfortable while travelling and in local trains they cannt travel as much as free as they are traveling in those trains in this kind we can make our state more popular and site seeing places for the foreigners they can provide trains and make our country as a developed country these are the very good means of transport to travel safely to their destination point&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so according, to my point of view bullet train is better than better trains but both the trains &amp;nbsp;are equal in one or the other aspects depending on the people`s&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;needs and people`s point of view .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we develop or introduce these bullet trains with low cost and affordable to any person and make some changes to travel to any place at any time with some facilities where those facilities can be satified by the middle class people they usually prefer these trains because &amp;nbsp;they can`t go in airways by using and paying those much of cost and they cannot afforade them so &amp;nbsp;they can use these bullet trains with those facilities to travel to their destination point safely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bullets use the less space and feel comfortable to travel to less destination place and where they can be on time to their required work and make them feel affordable with those price for what they are paying and what facilities they are getting in that &amp;nbsp;aspect they can prefer to that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
