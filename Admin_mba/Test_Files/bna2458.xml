Discuss in detail the impact of training and development on employee job performance.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Performance is the key to career growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Based on the skills and knowlege and attitude of the candidate we should measure performance. Now a days most of the candidates they should follow the specific measurements to achieve their goals, &amp;nbsp;And the most of the candidates they have good at their subjects and in any other field. Parents have to give freedom to their childrens to choose their carreer. For example i am working in a company HSBC, am good at my subjects and my communications skills are not good at that time am not getting good salary and am not getting promotions in the company, and my friend is having good communication skills and subject he is getting good salary and he get promotion. based on our performance our career should be improve other wise no one can remember our talent. Always we have to learn new things from others and we should rectify our mistakes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;"Patience is the key element of success" always we should remember this thing and work hard. and our 13 th president abdul kalam azad says that "learning leads to thinking, and thinking leads to knowledge, and knowledge makes your great". And alwys we should learn new things and improve our knowledge and skills. our father of the nation(mahathma gandhi) says that "beauty is an intenal quality which is not visible to physical eyes".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Training and development gives extra knowledge and skills to employee, and the employee can apply those things in the real time and they should increase their efficiency levels, Now a days most of the candidates they should not concentrate on the career, and they are working for money. Alwys we should remember one thing "first you have to learn then after you will earn". When the training period they employee should concentrate on the subject after the completion of the training the employee should apply what he /she learn from the training. now days most of the companies give extra benefits to the employees for example Tcs is the company it gives compensation to the employee. compensation means reward like car and building for the employee. any way training gives an extra boost to an employee. A job is an special type of task we need to perform in a good manner, every time we need to rectify our mistakes and we need to calculate our performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Impact of training and development on the employee: 1)emolyee has to learn things in the short way, 2)he/she has to improve their knowledge and skils on the work, 3)he/she has to learn new things from others, 4) employee has getting new ideas, 5) company performance increases and company has to getting new projects, 6) company earn more profits, 7) Company financial position and performance increases, 8) company pay regular dividend to the share holders, 9) company repay debt to the creditos, 10) company has to expand its business operations, 11) company has to purchase buildings and machinery, and 12) company has develop the infrastructure in the company, 13) Its going to merge/ take over other companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
