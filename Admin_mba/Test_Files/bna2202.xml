Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Narendar Modi started clean india programme.clean india is a very important topic.As you all know that how our india is becoming day by day everyone is througing the wastage on the roads because of this there are so many diseases entering into our country.All the people are suffering from different types of diseases.But then also no one is interested in cleaning india.Because changing the attitude is very important than the movement.If people change their attitude then only we can implement the action without changing the attitude of the people we cannot implement the action.First of all the people should have interest in cleaning india.Without the interest of people we cannot do anything everyone has to take the responsibility of cleaning india.When it comes to clean india &amp;nbsp;programme we should see in which position we are &amp;nbsp;and we should not think that it is not our responsibility of cleaning india.we should feel as it is the resposibility of each and everyone.we should not differentiate bettween the male and female and we should not think that it is the work of only female ones not ours.weather we are in the office or we are at home we should take the responsibility of cleaning india.Their is a saying like "ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING".If people change their attitude then we can start the movement.Each and everyone should take the initiative of cleaning india.It should come from the hearts of the people not by the force of others.when people promise themselves that they should clean india and be free from the diseases then only we can implement into action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone should take this programme as their responsibility and start their actions. we should make people aware of this programme in rural areas also through radio and television.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;we should put dust bins in each and every street.Each and everyone should take the initative of their own area and they should make sure that everyone is throughing the garbage in the dust bin.while coming to rural areas we should make them aware of this programme clean india.we should tell them the importance of this programme.we should tell them if we dosen`t clean india what happens.we should encourage them to change their attitude towards clean india programme.In rural arears wash rooms are very important because now also in so many villages people dont have wash rooms at their home. someone should take the responsibility of constructing wash rooms for them and each and every house should have the dust bin. we should make sure that all the people are throwing the garbage in their own dust bins and we should see that each and every street is having one government ward for collecting the garbage. After putting all those things into the consideration then only we can implement them into actions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
