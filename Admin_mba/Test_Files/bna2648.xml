&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="underline"&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;INTRODUCTION&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The useage of plastic has been banned in india in recent times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Government of india passed a strong resolution in the parliment to stop useage of plastic bags in the country,as they are harmful to environment govt has taken various steps to ban useage of plastic bags in india. the revenue earned on plastic will be balanced on introducing paper bags and cotton bags etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEASURES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The useage of paper bags and cotton bags can balance the economy as well as environment the revenue generated by the paper bags and cotton bags sales can balance the economy and the usage of the paper bags is ecofriendly in nature, this bags life is less than plastic bags and they desolve in the soil very soon and it dose not cause any pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promotional ads for the ban of plastic has been increased to create awearness to the society so that people stop using plastic which is dangerous to our lives. Gardually the usage of plastic has been come down in recent times all the malls and shops are providing paper bags and joot bags by charging some amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plastic has become a part of our daily life, we use plastic in our homes, offices almost every were which has to be stopped as it is creating a a lot of pollution and it is very dangerous to the environment.Government and other private organizations, NGO`S have started various awearness programs to ban useage of plastic in our daily lifes which is very dangerous to human lifes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it is made clear that there will be balance between the economy of the country as well as environment as they are the most important aspects of the country.The government of india has provided a set of guidelines to maintain balance between the economy of the country and as well as environmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has served notices to all the business organizations to stop using plastic in the production and manifacturing process. if this happens then demand for the paper bags increase and gradually the econamy of the country will also increase and there will be no pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manifacturing units of plastic are slowly decreasing 70% percent of them are shut down and remaning are running their business unoffically. if this are completely shut down then their will be no plastic pollution in the country. the government is encouraging the manifacturing units of paper bags, cotton bags, joot bags, by providing them financial assestence so that they can function more effeciently and provide ecofriendly bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How ever it is clear that if the manifacturing units of paper bags increase then gradually there will be a increase in useage of these bags. All the shopping malls and shops are providing the joot bags as well as paper bags by charging some nominal charges,so that plastic is banned completely. There are some are set of rules and procedure&amp;nbsp; to maintain balance between the economy and eniveronment of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing intrest in phones with screens over 5 inches will not reduce sales of small tablets. it won`t noticable cut into the market for larger tablets, however the size of screen increased dramatically. the average size of a smart phone now at present is around 5.5 to 6.0 inches. there is a decrease in time spent making voice calls as the device is providing more flexble options and to the user to do is work more effeciently by using video calls. tablets have wide range of options some have only wifi option and some of them have both celluar as well as wifi option so the user chosse the better option for him if the mobile phone is his choice then use it in many ways. the demand for ipad is still going on the interface of ipad is much better than iphone and the visiblity and clarity of the ipad is little bit different than a phone. the point is buying both ipad and a phone will be a choice of the user. if the user want to do is office work then he preffers a tablet beacause the visiblity and editing options will be more and tablet is user friendly than a mobile phone. the user uses the mobile phone for taking calls and use some social networkling apps and he uses tablet for working on some important work for example : ms-office&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;The demand for the small tablets has not decreased it has changed. many people won`t carry phablet and still carry a tablet for home and office use .families also keep small tablets instead of phones. many of them buy small tablets for thier childern which are inexpensive.The demand for some preminum large screen tablets like ipad air will be affected by the large growing sales of phablets. There are some tasks that can be performed equally on phone and tablet but tablet`s provide for flexablity and it also provide more editing options so that the user can perform is work more effeciently.Yes some tablets have options to make calls and some are not having that option. But with face time and google duos the user can make a video call and do his more effeciently. yes these are playing a vital role in every business organization face time and google hangouts are helping the organiztions to work more effiecntly and accurately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Title: Tablets vs Phablets: Strong Sales of Large Phones Will Cut into Demand for Small Tablets&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Growing interest in phones with screens over 5 inches is going to reduce sales of small tablets. It won&amp;rsquo;t noticeably cut into the market for larger tablets, however.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;In recent years, the size of phone screens has grown dramatically. The average smartphone display measured 2.6 inches in 2007, and is now 4.9 inches. Partially driving this has been a steady decrease in the time spent making voice calls &amp;ndash; a typical person spent 720 minutes a month talking on a cell phone in 2011, but 673 in 2013. As people come to use these devices as portable computers more than simple mobile phones, larger screens have become more valuable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;This trend has reached the point that handsets large enough to rival tablets made up about 40% of the global smartphone market in the first quarter of 2014.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Small tablets are typically sold to people who want a light-duty computer with a display that&amp;rsquo;s larger than the one on their phone but is more portable than a laptop. The growing numbers of people who get a phone with a screen over 5 inches in size will see little need for a device with a screen that&amp;rsquo;s barely any bigger than their phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;For example, the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch display that will inevitably reduce demand for the iPad mini which has 7.9-inch screen because their functionality overlaps. If you&amp;rsquo;re just checking email and social networks, what would be the point in buying both?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Demand Has Changed, Not Stopped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Increasing interest in larger phones won&amp;rsquo;t kill off all demand for small tablets. After all, many people won&amp;rsquo;t want to carry a phablet and will still see a need for a larger tablet at home or office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Families may also keep small tablets from dying out completely. Many parents buy small, inexpensive tablets without service plans for their children. Parents are also more willing to give a sub-$200 tablet to a child than a phone, many of which cost over $500 to replace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;No matter what happens to small tablets, many market watchers do not expect demand for full-size models like the iPad Air to be affected by growing sales of phablets. IDC &amp;ldquo;expects more consumers to shift back toward larger-sized tablets with their next purchase.&amp;rdquo; Meanwhile, the Motley Fool wrote that the release of the iPhone 6 Plus &amp;ldquo;could ultimately drive mix up from the lower-cost iPad mini models and toward the full-sized iPads.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;While there are some tasks that can be performed equally as well on a 5- to 6-inch screen as on a 9- to 13-inch one, there are many others that require more real estate. As examples, while someone could use a 5.7-inch Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or a 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab 4 to order a pizza or Google an actress&amp;rsquo; filmography and have the same experience, but the full-size tablet offers significantly better functionality for watching a movie or writing a report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The line that people have drawn between phones and tablets is blurring, and maybe even fading. While screen size certainly varies over a wide range, both types of devices are small, slate-shaped computers without physical keyboards. One of the few remaining differences is that one type can make phone calls and the other can&amp;rsquo;t, but with FaceTime and Google Hangouts, does that really matter these days?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
