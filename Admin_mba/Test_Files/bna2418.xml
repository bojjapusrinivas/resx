&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;India is one of the developing country which includes millions of population.iIn order to facilitate number of people in the country to travel from one place to anotther, country must provide transpotation facilities.there are number of modes of transportation are available for the people to travel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;one of the best mode of transportation is railways.there are number of trains available to travel from one state to another from one country to another country.offering better travelleing facilities to the people helps the government in fulfilling the needs of the people in travelling.In recent days many innovations have took place in many areas,even in the modes of transportation of railways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullet trains are one of them which helps the people to travel easily comfortably,and on time.These trains are more useful for India to develop technologically which further relies on economic development.prople must be made aware of the new technology made in the transpotation field so that they able to make use of the technology.Bullet trains can also &amp;nbsp;be affordable by common people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As India is one of the &amp;nbsp;developing country which requires technological development, there is a huge need of development in all the sectors.under the service sector &amp;nbsp;government must undertake such railway technologies which will tend to increase India`s GDP. Bullet trains helps the government by generating huge money. It helps the people to travel riskless. In today`s era people lokking for comfortable during ther travelling time at the affordable prices.when this need was undertaken by the government people become satisfied which tends to increase ther interest in travelling by better trains.this mode of transportation helps the government in many ways .few among them are poicking up many people at a time,no &amp;nbsp;traffic jams in the cities which ultimately reduces envirnonment pollution. At the same time many of the people can travel which is the only facility available in the railway mode of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Bullet trains plays a vital role in generating income for the country. In the past days people travell for a longer time with least facilities by trains.only few people who can sdpend good amount ,can travel comfortablly.But in recent days due to technological development took place in the railways ,people can travel comfortably at the affordable prices.one of them is the bullet train which helps the people to travel comfortablly only in few hours.they can reach there destination easily without any delays.due to this reason many people are showing interest to travel in bullet trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in India among the three sectors i.e Agriculture sector,Industry sector and Service sector,service sector is growing tremendiously by generating highest income to the government by offering new innovative services to the prople. As railways under the service sector is also &amp;nbsp;generating good income to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;still there is a need for tetechnological &amp;nbsp;innovations in railways. because innovations helps the people to make and feel &amp;nbsp;better . by developing new technology it &amp;nbsp;helps the people , government and the society .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is still in developing level due to lack of technology which is playing a very imporatant role across the world. adopting new technology from the other countries leads to huge costs which effect our economy.In India we &amp;nbsp;are available with many resorces.we should make use of those resources ,must create opportunities so that there is a chance of getting in to developed stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;adopting technological train i.e bullet trains helps the india in economic development by generating income to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
