Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, I agree with the statement. Change is more important than the movement. Firstly we should bring awarness among people then automatically change will takes place.If attitude of a person changes towards the situation then definitely there will be change. making awarness and not putting that one into action is waste of time ,so if we are making people aware of cleanliness then we should make them to convert that one into action by supporting and motivating them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; we should conduct some campaign programmes to make them aware and should help them in how to implement them in their daily life. we should explain them what are the problems we will face if the surroundings were not clean. Explanation makes them clear understanding , if they understand then will implement the change.As citizens of the nation,we should be responsible for the better society so atleast we should keep our surroundings clean. It will be example to many other people and that make change in attitude towards cleanliness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Government should implement some other programmes like swachh bharath to bring change for clean and green city . Government alone cannot do anything without support of the public. As individuals we should be responsible for our society, that will be the good sign to the our society and ourselves.As we are educated , we should educate others to be clean and neat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
