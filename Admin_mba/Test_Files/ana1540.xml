What has been the performance of small states that were carved out previously from large states? Have they fulfilled the demands of the people or is it just plain power politics at play? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For India to progress, I believe, we really need smaller states.&amp;nbsp; When the state is big, Mostly the&amp;nbsp;development of the state is happening only on the basis of capital of the state and&amp;nbsp;not the other areas which are really&amp;nbsp;very backward in education, employment and facilities(like hospitals, transportation, networking, shopping etc.,.).&amp;nbsp; When we take the example of Telangana State which has been divided recently from Andhra Pradesh, I believe that there are possibilities of development of the state as well as problems occurring due to electricity, water supply and employment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When we take the example of Andhra Pradesh, before dividing the state the development took place mostly in Hyderabad, as it was the capital of the city.&amp;nbsp; Hyderabad city has many facilities like hospitals, employment facilities(in both IT and Non-IT) and transportation in every respect.&amp;nbsp;In Hyderabad,We have Shamshabad Airport ,which is among Top 10 in world&amp;#39;s best Airport which has both International and&amp;nbsp;Domestic Airlines.&amp;nbsp; When the people of other places like example&amp;nbsp;Guntur,want to travel to any other country, then they&amp;nbsp;need to come to Hyderabad to&amp;nbsp;fly.&amp;nbsp; So, I&amp;nbsp;think if we divide the large state into smaller states, there are chances of development of each and every city comparing to being in a large city.&amp;nbsp; The&amp;nbsp;scope of employment increases a lot&amp;nbsp;in this regard.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The government did not take any measures to develop other telangana areas like Warangal, Karimnagar and also in the same way Andhra areas like Guntur, Vijayawada and Vizag etc.,.and&amp;nbsp;also only &amp;nbsp;main cities have developed leaving small villages.&amp;nbsp; In small villages, we have many problems like water.&amp;nbsp; Still we can see many&amp;nbsp;people in villages&amp;nbsp;have to travel 2-4 kilometres daily for drinking water.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In previous aspect, we can observe Uttaranchal which has been divided previous to division of Telangana.&amp;nbsp;I believe that after&amp;nbsp;carving into smaller state it has not developed any thing&amp;nbsp;rather than facing problems.&amp;nbsp; and even&amp;nbsp;people of the state feeling the same.&amp;nbsp; So, I believe both development and losses&amp;nbsp;in some aspects takes place for every&amp;nbsp;small state when they carve from large state.&amp;nbsp; It takes some time to develop, as lot of planning and implementation to be done for the small state.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; Mainly the politicians should play key role in the development of &amp;nbsp;every part of the city.&amp;nbsp; They should be able to fulfil the demands of the people in all respects&amp;nbsp;rather than enjoying with their ministries and &amp;nbsp;shares.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Finally, I conclude this topic saying&amp;nbsp;that India will progress when we really have smaller states and also the ministries should take part in developing the state in all the aspects and fulfil the demands of the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
