Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Hi gd mrg..today my topic is about making people aware is important,but more important is to convert awareness in to action.We have to aware from people what is importanat from others and also make sure that people are good enogh from awarenes..important thing is to awareness from action is basically need from all people ..so that people can give an action .For example some people have a knowledge about an internet which is usefull for all which have more skills ..internet can be used by different people they have awarenes about internet so that can make an team in the organization.Awareness is most important from all people so that can make an action from that people must se what is the situation from others and from all different people. They must have awareness about an topic or any place or it may be the company first they have to aware about an company so that can take an action for interw purpose..Awareness must convert in to action so that they can build there ability to give an action to other people awarenes make an good knowledge about an attitude changing ther movements..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Awareness must be like people may give an action or not and also there attitude will be change ..They have to take an action about any topic or any way such that they can make an importance about any action of people..people make an important aware about an communicating each other so that it may be the different changes..the people must communicate each other so that they can awaree about all things which they have to aware from others,they also take an action about an awarenes about any things or any company..The attitude will change and its more important to communicating people because they should have awareness about any company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Making people aware is important because they shold have an gards to communicate each other so that they can make an differnt action from different people.Having an aware is important also they should take an action from people different actions of any situation.They also take an action from others which is must important and also they have to make a change from others who all are willing to accept they action from different mentalty peoples..Awareness which is known as knowing people from different organisation and also from different mentality people..they should communicate each other so that they can aware each other..Attitude is most important from all peoples and also from all who are communicating each other which is an action..The people have ther own ideas about making people aware from each other they will change there movements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Government also have its own ability to change there movements it can clean india which is attitude and they to take an action about cleaning india which is more important in india.The people who will work each other they should also must have an important aware from different action..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Thank you as per my knowledge this all about making people aware is important,but more important is to convert awareness into action.. clean india-is attitude change more important than the movement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
