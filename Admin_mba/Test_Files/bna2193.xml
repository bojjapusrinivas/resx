Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Yes.I Do agree that Making people aware is important,but more important is to convert awareness into action.The movement Clean India more accurately known as Swach Bharat was initiated by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi about 1 year ago and was being implemented since then.The movement has brought more or less some change in the cleanliness of our country.But,I can say that the system is merely following the movement as a rule or a condition imposed by some higher authority and it is mandatory to do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; There are some instances in the past where few programmes have failed due to the orthrodox mindset of the people.I can take the example of marital harassments.Harassing for dowry after marriage was seen almost in most of the families in India.Women were considered as inferior compared to men and they were made to look after the household chores and were not allowed to be educated.It was considered unlucky for a woman to be educated as it would bring her badluck which would lead to her husband`s death which inturn would turn her into a widow.Moreover,the household work done by women was of no value.she was considered as a slave.To eliminate such customs and traditions,the government tried to educate and eradicate the people about what is good and what is bad.Despite of learning,the people prohibited such steps taken by the government.Therefore,the government made essential laws for the safety and security of the women.By this,the people were forced to accept the laws.if not,they would be behind the bars.We can see that Now-a-days also there is no change in the mindset of the people.They are simply accepting the laws as a sort of some force being applied on them.That is why,even now women are being killed for dowry and are being harassed.This example can be seen as a perfect example of how some movements fail due to the unchanging attitudes and mindsets of the people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Swach Bharat is also a movement suggested by the government and it can also be a failure if there is no change in the attitudes and mindsets of the people.People in India are so self-centered that they do everything for their own benefit.They consider their own houses as temples and the place out of their house as garbage.This style of thinking should be changed and people should be eradicated that the country should be treated as one`s own family not only in the consitution but also in everyone`s mind.If there comes a change in the attitude of the people,then we can immediately and proudly say that India is a developed country.Otherwise,after some millions of years also,India would be still considered as a developing country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
