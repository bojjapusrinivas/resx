Please take a stand and discuss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around two decades ago, a girl named Shivantikaa was born to a disntinctive family surrounded with loads of happiness, treasure of ideas and creativity. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I am blessed to have been brought up in a family where good education, traditions and customs are considered to be the key of a successful and peaceful life. My parents have always been the guiding force to drive me through my happiness and sorrows. They have been my pillars of support and have always shown me the coorect path. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;My education is in itself a labyrinth of different schools in different states of India and combination of different courses starting from B.A Mass Communication to MBA in Human Resources. Maybe now I understood why my friends call me &amp;#39;Miss Dictionary&amp;#39;, its because of the good core education I have taken up in 16years of my life.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Apart from education, I like to always showcase my creative ideas through art and craft, dancing, reading and my favourite cooking. I am a girl with strong determination and have the zeal to learn new things because I believe there is never an end&amp;nbsp;to learning.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;More than one billion Indians&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;#39;Incredible India!&amp;#39;,&amp;nbsp;this&amp;nbsp;is the other&amp;nbsp;name of my country India. There was a time when India was considerd to be a land of snake charmers, black magic,&amp;nbsp;villages, and poverty. Today, after coming a long way, India has been the new emerging star with loads of opportunities, weel versed education system and above all the&amp;nbsp;population of India. It is mesmerizing to know that&amp;nbsp;we are a population of&amp;nbsp;one billion,&amp;nbsp;breath-taking, isn&amp;#39;t it? Some consider it as the biggest hurdle for the growth of the country, but I feel if&amp;nbsp;given a chance this population would help India touch the stars of success and peace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Recently, I&amp;nbsp;completed my project titled &amp;#39;Key Result Areas of the Employees&amp;#39; wherein I found that If in an organization, employees are explained their roles, duties and responsibilities then it directly boosts their performance and these employees are encouraged to work better towards the organizational goals and objectives. Now, implying the same criteria to our country we can say that India is an organization with one billion&amp;nbsp; workmen under it. If each group of this population is told its roles and responsibilties then think how well are country would grow. I agree that its a difficult and time consuming task and it requires a lot of patience but in todays world of cyber cafe&amp;#39;s where everything is jus one click away reaching a large number of people at a time is not&amp;nbsp;a difficult task. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;If the&amp;nbsp;so called literates&amp;nbsp;and the vvips of are country come together to work towards the upbringing of its population in a&amp;nbsp;better way then are country can become one of the richest countries of the world in terms of its workmen and sheer talent of&amp;nbsp;its population.&amp;nbsp;They say &amp;#39;Try for the stars so that atleast you can reach the moon&amp;#39;&amp;nbsp;so instead of&amp;nbsp;saying that&amp;nbsp;its difficult to&amp;nbsp;upbring one billion for the&amp;nbsp;country&amp;#39;s growth we must say we&amp;#39;ll try to upbring as many people as we can for their as well as country&amp;#39;s growth after&amp;nbsp;all they are all &amp;#39;INDIANS&amp;#39;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
