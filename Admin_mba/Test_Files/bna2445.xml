&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In my point of view Bullet train are the best and fastest train to reach the destination.India needs Bullet train that would help indians in various aspect ,As per the survey the satistical analysis we have noticed people in India are from different counteirs they settele in India and start their economic background in various feilds.So in my view i suggest Bullet trains are the best one to travel any place to reach their destination in a shorter period of time.I have seen many countries their are bullet trains that would be easier for the employers amd employees to have a safe jouerny.India is a democratic country country.Coming to Bullet trains in India is best of reaching hights comaprins other counteirs. Budgeting system in india, It depends on the economic growth that would bring vigorous changes that would help our budget ministry to take a step forward in this budget esteem &amp;nbsp;to bring a change in our Country Indi.India is developing countrty and dramatically, It should start with the boomimg IT and growth in economic that can target to take a further steps in planing Bullet trains and they should paln it in a conditional programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Indian politics plays important role to bring a Bullet trains in India they should be aware of all the economic status. That is currently ruuning in India,And we can survey on the population that would give best platfrom to Bullet trains in India.Bullet trains protects global warming.Indian population growth is very high and we need to run our economic growth in such way that each and every survey is important to bring a drastic change in our country India.Regarding our popolation the Two wheelers and four wheelers are causing lot of pollution and that is effecting global warming due to this scanty rainfall is veery less.The Goverment of India should counduct a survey of the popullation so that they can come to a conclusion that to take a imporatant step in bring a Bullet trains India.As per my view the poullation in india that iseither poor or middel people or rich ones are busy in their daily workers and they are not having a proper health and they can`t work properly due to their tiredness in traveling so that they can`t contribute best in performance in their working feild.Our honarabel Prime Minster Narender Modi ji has to take further steps in developing India.Bullet trains would comfort in many ways;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; Eg:They can travel from their place to reach the destination in na short period of time.And saftey is the best part that would land the passengers safely.Their is no issues faced by .The Passengers cannot be effected by the pollution in the cites due to thes they can protect their health and do best in their organisation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;If I talk about the difference betweem Bullet trains and Better trains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In my point of view they both play improtant role in railways the reason is the importantace of Better trains are they can`t reach the destination in fastest way but they still are working in India for the pepole ,who are traveling with their own comfortabel budget.Better trains are safer if their is no crowd.But the fact is in India we find passenger`s travel in Better tains are crowdy and their is no limt in local trains.And their is no different compartments yet in few Better trains this would bring loss to the railway, Due to no rules and regulation which is not followed by the passenger`s and railways.That would remark them bad in certain feilds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Bullet trains are fast mode of transport that can give comfrotabel way of travelling in bullet tarins.Budget can play an important role to the poor or middel class people.But Bullet trains can cost to the comforts of all class pepole in respect to the Goverment order.Comfortabel life gives you the best movement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Conlusion: My view is Bullet trains are far better than Better trains.The impact of getting Bullet trains in our country would be the best way of reaching the targets in various firms and Economically forcaesting the right way of grooming the industries and IT (Informational Technology),"The best way of Goverment putting efforts in geting the best product would help every one in India and satisfying the markets that are curically playing vital role in all aspects.IM PROUD BE AN INDIAN&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
