What do you think are the major steps that can be taken in present circumstances to push growth in the country?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Indian Economy can rise only if all the Indians unite and dedicate to bring the change. Only one citizen cannot change the whole&amp;nbsp;Economy of the country.&amp;nbsp;A very basic step to increase economical growth in our country is Education for child and labour. Also there are many other suggestions to my mind that can help to develop our country&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;well as our Economy.&amp;nbsp;Few of them are Political System, Police System, Knowledge of other countries and there culture, and etc.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Conclusion: Yes, If we want to grow our countries&amp;nbsp;Economical growth, We can make it. We can make a lot of changes only if we unite and work together to change .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
