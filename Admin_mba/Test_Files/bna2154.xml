<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3/10/2016 10:41:31 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To inculcate the spirit on entrepreneurship in India, the Government launched &amp;lsquo;Start-up India&amp;rsquo; initiative in January 2016. Do you think this initiative would be a historic moment in ushering the era of economic prosperity in India. Please elaborate with reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of entreprenuership is an idea which many have but not many can put into practice. &amp;nbsp;The very idea of entreprenuership brings into mind lot of hardships, less money, more worries and an overall &amp;nbsp;sense of dejection and disappointment. &amp;nbsp;However, there are a few determined souls, who are willing to take the risk and get headlong into it, but only a very few are able to reach a stage where they can say, "Yes, I have done it and now I can think of growing."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any idea to suceed, there should a clarity of thought as to who all can be included, what financial help they can get and where can a person get technical and moral support. &amp;nbsp;The prime minister, hailing&amp;nbsp;from state of Gujarat which is a leading state where entreprenuership is very prevelant, has come up with an idea of "Start-up India." &amp;nbsp;The slogan looks catchy and gives a feeling of saying, yes we can to all those who are ready to take the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we go beyond just the slogan, there are a few &amp;nbsp;aspects&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;that has not been made clear. &amp;nbsp;First and foremost, who all can take part in this initiative? &amp;nbsp;Can a person who opens a small kirana store or a mom-and-pop store be included in the "start-up initiative." &amp;nbsp;There is just a vague idea but no real clarity. &amp;nbsp;Secondly, what is&amp;nbsp;the financial help that will be delivered and how much will the banks lend and what is the rate at which they will be lending it. &amp;nbsp;Everybody runs behind a IT start-up, but a large swathe of popultaion lives in the rural and semi-urban areas where the penetration of technology is not there, and as such banks are hesistant to lend. &amp;nbsp;Last but not the least, what is the support that a budding new entreprenuer will have. &amp;nbsp;Starting a incubator for technical start-ups is good but what about the start-ups in other areas, say agroprocessing, small scale industries dealing with machinery and even small scale companies that produce plastic goods, which are cheap but are very useful for day-to-day needs of the people; to whom can they turn to if they need any help?. &amp;nbsp;These are a few basic things which has to be cleared first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this programme to suceed, the government has to do two things. &amp;nbsp;First and formost, get the new educated but unemployed people into this scheme. &amp;nbsp;Show them the opportunity and also show them how can they grow. &amp;nbsp;Show them that if they produce a certain thing, there is a market for it and provide a financal help and give them tax breaks and make the banks lend money at cheap rate so that the idea is not killed for the want of money. &amp;nbsp;Secondly, make big industries a part of the initiative. &amp;nbsp;For ex. AMUL has been helping people open their own stores and providing raw materials, and financial help for a &amp;nbsp;limited period of time and helping them with the sale of their product by helping them decide which is the ideal place to open a store and how can they market their store etc. &amp;nbsp;Though it is a small initiative, many people have opened AMULs stores. &amp;nbsp;This has helped AMUL in many&amp;nbsp;way, they are able to&amp;nbsp;cater to new markets, have more sales and have more franchisees into their fold. &amp;nbsp;This in turn, has helped many others get employment. &amp;nbsp;So the spin-off is manifold. &amp;nbsp;The same idea can be taken to a macrolevel by the government and they can cajole big industries to help the budding entreprenuer. These can be made a part of CSR initiaitives of the companies and the companies can be given a tax holidays etc for helping these initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always said, if we have the grit and determination and if we have the will then we can succed. &amp;nbsp;So, the government has started a thing, now they have to follow up and ensure that this initiative is a success. &amp;nbsp;If the above mentioned things are implemented, then it is a gaurantee that we will have many entrepreneurs and the country can become a beacon of light as far as entrepreneurship is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;Across the world, there is a significant increase&amp;nbsp;in the number of people who come to reside in the cities. In 2014, the urban population has accounted for 54 percent as compared to 34 percent in 1960 of the total world population. This shift would level out during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 period and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population on an yearly basis. Severe&amp;nbsp;limitation like geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth of a city and thus a far greater number of high-rises will have to be commissioned, which will eventually trigger an increased&amp;nbsp;demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the ever-rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Major Growth Factors:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The &amp;nbsp;smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly globally. The market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020 largely driven by modernization of existing elevator systems . With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. Roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world is accounted by China alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over a period of time, upcoming high-rise buildings would need to&amp;nbsp;adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems; as a result of which smart elevators market would surpass the modernization segment revenue and would contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, vendors of vertical transportation systems are &amp;nbsp;shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. A major market player&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated modern technologies like cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. Similarly, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully installed a modernized PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico in 2014. Some other iconic buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system are The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Innovations:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people, elevators consume large amount of energy. Therefore, major palyers in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The Road Ahead:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;A major driver of growth of overall smart elevator market would be the commercial application of the smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Major areas&amp;nbsp;where smart elevators are being used commercially are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). However each sectors have different requirements and the &amp;nbsp;design and capacity of the elevators differ across all sectors. For eg. residential buildings have lesser traffic across floor as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the load and the passenger capacity varies. &amp;nbsp;In healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers wherase in malls and multiplexes, the focus is on vandal proof material of smart elevator. In addition to these, spacious and ride comfort elevators are a prerequisite &amp;nbsp;in retail and warehouses. Therefore, each elevator is designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
