Discuss three key factors for making `Make in India` a reality.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Making India a Manufacturing Hub is a great make over as our india is a emerging country. India is a smart global country in which we have all the facilities for making a Manufacturing Hub, there is a practical possibility for making `Make in India` a reality. Make in india is a great intellectual scheme for the indian economy. The concept of `Make in India` is possible for the MODI government to implement it in our country. To accpmplish such schemes the government should be perfect and they should know what it actually is and this scheme beneficial to all the people in our country. As we know that India has developed many Strategies and have implemented those strategies for the well-being of our country, it also has the strategies devoloped and tied up with the US companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Coming to start up companies India has many start up`s and many innovations has been done in our country. Launching of Manufacturing Hub is a innovative idea wherein we need to have a clear idea about that. There is a possibility of making India a Manufacturing Hub, the factors for making it a reality are:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; The Government should encourage Start up Company`s : Encouraging Start up companies&amp;nbsp; brings a lot of change in peoples mind and the will have a clear perception that they will get the jobs. Not only the government should take the initiative even the people in our country should also know about what are the start up companies and what are it for. The government as well the people should encourage start up companies as it is a good source for the country and beneficial for the country. The employment for all the educated citizens of the country who have the abilities, skills etc.. of that company should be given a priority of getting particular job role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; The Existence of Innovative products into the market :&amp;nbsp; The products that are into the market should be innovative products. Many of the vendors in the industry/Market have a clear idea about the product for what it is used and what it is used. Some products in the market have high competition due to their effectiveness and eficiency. There should be a creativity among the people to produce the innovative products and get successful so that they gain profits and have a right place in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; Allowing Partnership and merges with foreign countries : The partnership should be taken by the people who are affordable to that and this merging with the other companies (US based) is an great thing that can be done prior to this patnership, by merging with other companies and taking partnership we have a scope of maintaining a global company. The partnership also needs a investment and if the company gets successful there will be huge profits for them and this should be done in a legal way. We have many companies in the U.S and most of them are merged with the companies in India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; Effective Research and Development: The Effective R&amp;amp;D should be developed indorder to get the products that are most efficient and effective. This Research and Development(R&amp;amp;D) department is playing a prominent role in every organisation/industry. First the research is done for a product and if it is successfulit goes for development process then further it comes into the market. Research and development aim for the growth of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The government should provide awareness about what it actually is, and how is it used for. As of now it is a good job of making our country a `DIGITIZED COUNTRY`. After the announcement of digitization every one are using the mobile payments without having the cash in hand. This digitization is a great initivative for the country and by this many peeople are using this mode of paying the bills,ordering etc.., There are many start up companies in our country and are having employees working in it and furthermore, there should be a great development in our country making `India a manufacturing Hub`.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market &amp;ndash; An Insight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development. With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action. Like many emerging market countries, Brazil has high rates of non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also has a rapidly growing economy, which is beginning to strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it&amp;nbsp; set a non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However,&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; August&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2012, the&amp;nbsp; government&amp;nbsp; announced&amp;nbsp; an&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;opt--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;in&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meter&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; regulation&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; customers,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Paired with&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; requiring&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; new&amp;nbsp; customers.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp; was&amp;nbsp; not&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; anticipated&amp;nbsp; market&amp;nbsp; catalyst&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; those&amp;nbsp; expecting&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; binding&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; replace&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million existing legacy&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; result,&amp;nbsp; Northeast&amp;nbsp; Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its initial 63 million smart meter target. Yet, some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be achieved, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;With strong underlying economic and political conditions, it is inevitable that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade. The question is simply how fast deployments will take place. Through a combination of new meter installations, smart meters targeted at reducing non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt; technical losses, and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications, more than half of Brazilian homes will have smart meters by the end of the decade. However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
