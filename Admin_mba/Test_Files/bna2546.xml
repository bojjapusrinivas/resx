Discuss three key factors for making `Make in India` a reality.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Make&amp;nbsp; in india is a type of swadeshi movement covering 25 sectors of economy was launched by the government of india on 25th september 2014 to encourage companies to manufacture their products in india and also increase their investment . As per the current policy 100% FDI permitted in all the 25 sectors , expect for space , defence and news media . japan and india had also announced aus b$ 12 billion japan - india make in india special finance facility fund to push investment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;After launching" make in india " india has got so many worthy investment commitments. India emerged as the top destination globally in 2015.strong initiatives such as the GST are the reason for the new india . our prime minister has proposed this make in india and also he had came up with many new ideas to develop india such as swach bharat, digital India, beti bachavo beti padavo soo many changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Narendra modi ji has started this make in india on 25th september 2014 as on 3years has passed it was continuing with success and with soo many reward and investment commitments. and this make in india is completely a practical one not any dream to imagine that india would be like this if we start this or anything. It is a completely a practical ly possible thing and it is running with its success . as&amp;nbsp; on 3 years has passed it has achieved its succes it practically and not dramatically . if one can start his step everyone wil go on follow their footsteps if no one starts after&amp;nbsp; 20 years also it will be still developing nation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;the 3 key factors of making india reality is its vision,support,hardworking investments new ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1.vision :as starting the program of making india they had kept one vision to achieve .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2. support :as people supporting his thoughts he is going on achieveing his program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3. hardworking: if the workers or employers of the program are hardworkers , sincerety then the program will get succes and the investments go on increase and their will be a developed nation without doubt and its not any dream but it is a&amp;nbsp; practically possible thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;with that success we have started so many&amp;nbsp; things&amp;nbsp; like digital india , GST, so that people can also develop their minds .and also many schemes with this making india he had started . by this india has toped as globally developed nation by 2015. The government has started so many things but the well good things to develop the country was making india, digital india , and the last GST . these things will be good enough to india if they was worked practically. the government enacted legally with gst implementation and worked very crucially on those days . with this gst india really played avery prominent role .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008000; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The competitive landscape of vendors competing for this growing marketwas aperiod of change mostly in developed countries like north america, europe, and east asia markets.some of the large vendors offer integrated solutions with smart metering value chainby various providers and those are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments .this will improve the coordination between smart metering, distribution&amp;nbsp; automation and home energy management.In some areas the market is just beginning to grow .some dozens of local vendors had started to serve both smart grid projects, and larger vendor activity on their own and also as partners.In this emerging countries high growth rates projected represents the next frontierof fragmented local players.it will help to shape the speed and direction of the smart grid deployments of the globe.it takes it to look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendorslandscape . And how they are positioning themselves to succeed.Already there are 500 vendors in active in smart grid projects across the world .and assesses the&amp;nbsp; existing partnership , mergers , and acquisition that are altering the smart grid markets. Around 125 countries between 2015 and 2025 the smart grid investment will reach around $380. 1 billion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008000; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market -An Insight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008000; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;brazil is the fifth largest population in the world which is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development.And agovernment that is eager to modernize the country`s infrastructure.By the end of the decade it will be one of the largest smart grid markets.It is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government actions. It was the rapidly growing economy with high rates of non- technical distribution&amp;nbsp; losses. which will reap immediate revenue protection benefits which is the beginning to strain existing infrstructure.The smart grid will become increasingly important if the energy saving benefits and the reliability of the country continues to grow.The government has taken notice but in 2009 it has set a non binding target of replacing all 63 million existing electromechanical meters with smart meters by 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008000; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But in august 2012&amp;nbsp; the brazil government has came up with an new meter that is "opt-in"&amp;nbsp; its a regulation for existing customers with paired of mandate requiring for all new customers. It is not any anticipated market catalyst for those&amp;nbsp; who are expecting a binding mandate to replace all 63 million existing legacy meters with smart meters.But now the northeast group is calculating and imaginating that brazil will not reach its 63 million smart meter target but the government officials and regulators are still encouraging brazil with optimistic that the initial goal of smart meters will be reached.that may inspire their future incentive structure and smart metering regualtions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008000; font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But inevitably that brazil`s smart grid market will rapidly grow in the coming decades by the underlying economic and political conditions,this will enable us to know how fast deployments will take place.by the combination of new meter installations smart meter targetted reduced by the non technical losses and the customer eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications.By this most of the brazilian homes will also have the smart meters by the decade. but brazil has to meet its original goal of 63 million meters by 2021 however the august 2012&amp;nbsp; regualtion had felt short of the concrete mandate .but at last brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike brazil is one of the largest growing country in smart meters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms. With high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors and smaller, more fragmented local players will help shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. This study takes a comprehensive look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positioning themselves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across all regions of the world, highlights growing regions and market segments, and assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions that are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries, smart grid investment will reach $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. This study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of the hundreds of vendors competing for this growing market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market &amp;ndash; An Insight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development. With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action. Like many emerging market countries, Brazil has high rates of non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also has a rapidly growing economy, which is beginning to strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it&amp;nbsp; set a non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However,&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; August&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2012, the&amp;nbsp; government&amp;nbsp; announced&amp;nbsp; an&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;opt--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;in&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meter&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; regulation&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; customers,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Paired with&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; requiring&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; new&amp;nbsp; customers.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp; was&amp;nbsp; not&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; anticipated&amp;nbsp; market&amp;nbsp; catalyst&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; those&amp;nbsp; expecting&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; binding&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; replace&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million existing legacy&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; result,&amp;nbsp; Northeast&amp;nbsp; Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its initial 63 million smart meter target. Yet, some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be achieved, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;With strong underlying economic and political conditions, it is inevitable that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade. The question is simply how fast deployments will take place. Through a combination of new meter installations, smart meters targeted at reducing non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt; technical losses, and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications, more than half of Brazilian homes will have smart meters by the end of the decade. However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
