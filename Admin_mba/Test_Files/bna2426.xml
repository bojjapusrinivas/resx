&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;India as a developing country, definetely needs Better Trains in my view, because first and foremost thing is to provide with basic and minimum infrastructural facilities than providing with the highly sofisticated things or facilities. And speaking about India as we all know it is still in developing stage we cannot introduce Bullet Trains as it includes high investments which is indirectly gonna effect the budget of our country and the decission would be wrong if chosen and allotted for Bullet Trains. we actually need so many other things which are more important than the bullet trains. so as far my opinion better trains are important and needed in India. Keeping in view the growing population of India and providing them with adequate trains with minimum good and better facilities is more than enough for the public today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Better Trains with high security is the most important thing in railways as most of the people travel in trains in different tymings around the clock with their different shifts in these corporate world. Trains with security are most important and utmostly needed too. Most of the people prefer trains because it is the cheapest means of transport and all classes of people do prefer only trains keeping the convienience and the duration of their journey according to their affordability and comfort zones.High security systems and alertness in stations would reduce ,most of the accidents happening on the tracks , stations and even in the trains too. The very quick reacting teams are also needed which can shun most the illegal things going on in this transport. We come across many news and incidents that happen in trains and in the surroundings of the stations making use of all the facilities provided which are actually misused by wrong people so the security teams must be alert and quickly responding to any small change without overviewing them as their routine job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;It is good that the allotments in budget are high for the Railways but it is important to check whether those alloted funds are properly beeing used or not. All the government workers at all levels who are all involved in public services must be sincere, dedicated and responsible, because their role in their duties is not just a duty it is a responsibility given to them by the government to work for the people on behalf of it. For the people, by the people and of the people must be their motto. The means of transports are very important because it is the most happening place for so many things and so it it is mandatory to provide all basic facilities and must maintain and check the things frequently on regular basis on unbiased grounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Bullet trains cannot be introduced in India because of its infrastructural facilities and the culture of the people. People here not that civilised and fast moving which would actually suit for the bullet trains. Introduction of bullet &amp;nbsp;trains would make the people hurry and worry and which inreturn cause many problems further. Specially only few people of high class only will make use of it because of its cost and create differences among the people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Finally i would like to conclude saying that it is important to provide the basic things which people need the most and help them to cross the hurdles rather than providing with the sophisticated inventions ,the so called luxurious which &amp;nbsp;stand as a barriers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
