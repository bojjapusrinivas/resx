The mass media like television, radio and newspaper have great influence in people in the country.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In present Generation media is playing a key role in the society and in the country also. This media is changing mind set of the people in the country and people are also reacting to that news and they are observing each and everything which is happening in the country and overall country. Media has a full network of each and everything in country they will collect all set of news and gives information to the society through television,radio,newspaper..etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Initial days there is no proper media to communicate the news to the people and they to dont react to the news and there is no change in people views and ideas. Recently now a days people are listening to the radio regularly with this youth,uncle,aunt,...etc all kind of people are listening, and the radio people also giving an regular update of news through radio station.With this people are changing their views &amp;nbsp;ideas and opinions. In colleges also they have entered this mass media as a subject that who ever is intrested they can join this course and they will get a certificate from government, with this they can enter into this media.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Media is helpful in so many ways to the public. Like public is suffering from some problem in their society they are approaching this media and their problems to the society with this political people and government employee are also feared with this media, where they will get a bad name in the society.With this people are also going to the media people and solving their problems if anybody is not doing their duties properly. Now a days there are so many news channels, news papers, radio stations and people are using this social networking sites also to publish the news.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Now a days, Government has kept a General Awareness subject befor their pre recruitment process at the time of written exam. With this people are also reading the news and watching television and refering lot of books for current affairs to know the each an every aspect what is going in the society and with this they are getting new ideas and with that they are getting updated with the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; With this media they are getting news from the whole world and watching that were what is happening and with that people are also knowing what is going in the world. Example: If a Scientist have introduced something new product, this cannot known to the whole world without media, if the media is available then he will cover the great inventory and he will tell it to the world through television,newspaper,radio..etc and we also know his name,country and inventory product details with the help of media. With this people are challanging to their selfs and they are also trying to introduce something in their life and want to show it to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Media people they cover each and every ascept like world news,country news,stock exchange,sensex,economy,budget of the country...etc like this they will cover each and every single ascept which is happening in the in the country and the world.People are changing themselves and they are going into next generation by changing themselfs and changing their neighbours also. Youth is attracting to the media and they are getting started to change themself and changing other with their behaviour and style. Education system is also changed a lot with this media. Previously people dont use to go schools and now a days they are going to schools and in schools they are teaching with IT technology like using projectile and screen and giving lot of examples to understand the topic to the students. This is why i will say that mass media is playing a major important role in the society and in the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
