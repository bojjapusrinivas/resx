Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;yes, I agree with first sentence that, the awareness is not enough, people should show interest clean India and work on it. Frankly even I did nothing in the name of Swachh Bharath. most of the poiticians are on social media that they are supporting Swachh Bharath and they are also cleaning. Everyone know that that is only to show public that they have some resposnebility towards society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; However few celebrities are showing so much interest in the Swachh Bharath campaign. example salman khan, in a very busy time. he gave his whole day for a village i don`t remember the exact place. Salam and his friends cleaned and cloured the village it shows his dedication towards a campaign. one more Kapil sharma, at the his every show he will remind the audience" if you want a clean India first you have start from your place".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Our prime minister Narendra Modi, has shown so much interest and more importanly he his the person who started these campaign, and at every meet he used nominate few celebrities for the Swachh Bharath campaign. he also said that, THe river Ganga should clean. and it will take so much time clean a river. because people bear these are polluting the water so. Government should create the awareness among the peolpe and as I said awareness is not enough there should be change in the peolple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In a Promotional advertisement, our PM Narendra Modi said that each and every person start and think about the campaign Swachh Bharath then no power can stop India to be a clean and Green country. like me every Indian support these campaign but the only thing is, we should start cleaning our surrondings and tell others to do that. if we are able to inspire few people around us then there will be that change which Narendra Modi is looking for. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
