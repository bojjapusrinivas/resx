<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;11/13/2015 1:27:06 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sound education system keeps the foundation of prosperity and success for the country. Looking at current state of affairs of education in our country and the need to take India to the next level, should we change the present system of education with advanced technologies and innovative ideas? Discuss and elaborate with facts.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AS PER my knowledge the present system of education is having some importance like if we study properly and having good knowledge on the related topics of their subject then they&amp;nbsp;can automatically &amp;nbsp;teach the students in better way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;IT as somany difaults with the current system of education. Now a days everybody is looking for the profits of their own businnes. so the education system as became like a commercial manner rather then usefull to the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;many political leaders are involeving in educational institutions for their business perpose. due to the political leaders also the education system is becoming waste now a days situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IN the education their must be good foundation from the childhood. in ordrer to develop from the starting stage all the parents and teachers should be able to teach the good manners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the people like parents teachers and the whole soicety&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;should able to have some intersest about the country and students then we can change the presnet education system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;beacuse todays childern will be tommorow citines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;IN order to change&amp;nbsp;our&amp;nbsp;country and in oder to take the india from developing stage to developed stage we should have to develop from the basic level of education. such as we should implement new innovative ideas and new techonlogies in education system&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;new concepts like telling the students to make ppts and presnet the topic infront the class as a result their will be no stage fear and where ever they go they can easliy peresnt temsleves and develop &amp;nbsp;the society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;when compare to the other countries we are lacking beyond education system because of the new concepts , innovative ideas and new technology. somany people are somuch interested to work in the other countries rather then india it may be due to the remunaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;India should able to give good &amp;nbsp;remunartions then the people having very much knowledege and skills . then they wont leave &amp;nbsp;india then automatically india will go the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and all the people in the society should be able to do some type of service in one are the other way &amp;nbsp;rather then seeing always for their profits in yhe business and how to devleop themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMART ELEVATOR MARKET:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their is a modernization of exisiting elevator systems, so the global market is expected to grow significantly.and the market is expeted to change shift by 2020 with a few number of new developing asian countries. and it take over modernisation by 2020.and china is having accounts of roughly 53% of the upcoming high rise in projects around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;world wide green infrastracture reqirements are developing new stracures and current infrastrucutre arise in number of buildings with comfotable, efficient, and secure transportation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The harvest tower of bank of america in manhattan, the humana headquters in louisville and creasent in dallas are some o the buildings Their is valuble information about systems will improve its maintance service . Transportation system of vendors are currently shifted to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developed countries like us, uk and france has been a major contributor to modernization of market revenue. and their will be rise in buildings would developsmart elevator systems. with the revenue of 52% with overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smart elevators can be customised with&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the different reqirements of each and every user segments and can provide excellent realibilty, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and dexstination control, space and comfort with new advaced techonology feactures and communication, access control, and security techonology enables needs of various end use segments such ascommerical, healthcare, industrial, and hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IN urban their is 32%of the total&amp;nbsp;world population during 1960 and when it comes to 2014 their is a significant change in number of people residing in urban is 54%. when it comes to 2015-2020 and the cities across the world would be 1.8% growth in population every year.and limitation of geagraphical; expansion of cities would result vertical growth and high rise in projects. which will eventually greater deamand for more efficient elevators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;smart elevators. as a result it maintain and manges more than 1.1 million elevators. in 2014 it successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT. an its installed its smart elevator destinastion dispatch technology system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COMMERICAL APPLICATION TO BEEF UP TEH SMART ELEVATOR MARKET GROWTH:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elevators are desgined according to the purpose of teh elevators it may be change from palce to place such as it is different for offices hotels retails etc and it may varry in commercial bulidings&amp;nbsp;require deeper elevators and athe passenger capacity varies. and it reqires large amount of energy in the inter floor traffic of people. gaint players in the market innovate solutions to consume small power and customer experiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smarter technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of more and on the other hand maximises energy reduction .As a result mitsubishi has developeda multi elevator.in 2011 that reduces energy consumption apporximately 10%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
