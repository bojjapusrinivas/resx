&lt;p&gt;this people and sell their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my point of view it is not a waste of resources because more revenue can be generate through advertising as it is proved in market.&amp;nbsp; Even groceries, Mobiles, Furniture all household items all are available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in Internet. If not there is no such sales they won`t advertise and prompt their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;By modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a huge transformation by 2020. The global smart elevator market is growing significantly. The usage of elevators in Asian countries are gradually increasing, by this we can say that smart elevators could potentially takeover the market revenue by 2020. China alone is planning with 53% of this projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 115%;"&gt;As there is a huge increase in construction of new buildings globally it has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition to this&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements there is more rise in usage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 115%;"&gt;of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;In countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France these are the major contributors to smart elevator market revenue so far. From over a period, there is huge growth in construction of buildings which leads to development of smart elevator systems. By installation of smart elevators will lead to the modernization segment revenue and there will be a contribution of more than 52 percent of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technology wise there is advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and secure technology enables smart elevators which lead to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can fulfill all this unique requirements of each of these segments and can provide comfort, hygiene, durability, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort to end-user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;As there is huge change in the number of people residing in cities. According to statstics in 2014, the urban population increased to 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. This statistics gives us that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% rise in population every year. There is geographical expansion in cities which result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise in projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually lead to the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;The vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifted their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive in global market. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"&gt;A brief note on the smart elevator market growth in commercial era&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;This smart elevators market will be as a back-bone for the growth of the overall market in commercial era.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The usage of smart elevators are mostly used in commercial buildings such as offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, hospitals, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators will differ in both sectors. i.e., residential buildings will have less floating of people compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the design and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers go through it. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. Elevators are designed according to the purpose of their requirement. Space and comfort are essential in retail and warehouse elevators. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt;"&gt;As there will be less usage of elevators in residential buildings there will be not much consumption of energy comparatively with commercial buildings. So at this time Giant players in the market play major role for consuming less energy and good ride experience for customer. Mitsubishi developed a multi-elevator technology where&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 12.222222328186035px; font-size: 11px;"&gt;energy consumption will be decreased approximately to 10%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;This smart technology will focus on usage of elevators during peak hours of rush and on other side maximizes energy reduction during dull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
