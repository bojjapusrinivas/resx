Elaborate with facts. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, india will become the superpoer in the economic aspects in the nearby future. Now also we are able reach a good position&amp;nbsp;among the developed countries in the world. India having a high value among them. All the speeches of the PM of Russia as well as the president of US showing the same while they visited india. They announced as&amp;nbsp;GOOD regarding the economic growth of india. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now a days we are able to reach a high literacy rate. Besides this we have controlled our population rate.&amp;nbsp;Mostly all the indians were having earnings of&amp;nbsp;themselves. And all the exports of different products such as Fish, Spices, other natural products also showing a&amp;nbsp;high economic&amp;nbsp;growth.&amp;nbsp;The GDP rate of india is also very high compared to all other counties in the world.The education level of people in india attracts all the other counties for their outsourcing works. This will also helps for the high economic growth. Around 10 to 20% of people from india works abroad in diferrent counties. All these money flowing from other counties to india also helps alot in this aspect. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Most of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the experienced people in the area of Finace as well as Economic areas are from India. So their guidance and support also helps us for the same.&amp;nbsp;And by using all the natural resources carefully as well as exporting&amp;nbsp;to the high valued markets helps us to increase the flow of money to india.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So i am concluding that without any doubt we can see the name of India in the list of Economic Superpower Nations&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;For the same purpose we have to try from our end also. The co ordination of people as well as the leaders will help in acheiving this stage vey fast.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
