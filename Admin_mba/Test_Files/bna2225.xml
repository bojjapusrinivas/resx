Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;CLEAN INDIA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean India intruduced by Narendredramody, the aim of the concept is that developing a India . Ii was made on 15th augest 2015 &amp;nbsp;in mumbhi, Naredramody &amp;nbsp;was attended the meating which was spoke on develapment of the India in that particulor meataing, &amp;nbsp;Naredramody was spoke about the `CLEAN INDIA`.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Clean India mean`s not a cleaning the India developing the India.Making people aware about the India, for that what we need to do,what kind of the awarenes &amp;nbsp;we should make among the people, that is what aim of the `CLEAN INDIA`.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example so many politions ware partilcipated in nember of programs, but thay ware saying that if we just clean india we can get development in india&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;actualy it is not cleanig the India it is making awreness among the people about the india and who to develope the India by doing the basic things, that`s whate they have to share among the people, thay are just speaking about party and particulor problemes thay are not speaking about development of india,thay just doing something which is not related to development of &amp;nbsp;thay just cleanig the some place,and going from their,in my percaption thay should make people awareness about the basic things as an citizenwe should do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I participated in clean hyderabad programe which was inogreted by &amp;nbsp;K CHADRASHEKER RAO on &amp;nbsp;12th of december 2015.My experiace was i was participated in cleaing the streets,when i was cleanig the streets i was so happy that i also contributing something for India and i was also cortibuting somethig to get adevelopment of the India. At that particulor time i met one person who is irrresponsible towards the basic he must do for counrtry,he had taken one bred from shope and he ate that one and he just throing plastic on road, i went with him i asked him to take that particulor plastic keep it in destben aftor doing that particulor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;work i was felt so happy that i also participated in making awarenes among tahe people about clean India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;the clean India help the Iindia or state to get the development and make awareness among the people about basic things we should fallow and if we do&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those thinhs properly we can get the development or clean India or a clean state. As an student , citizen , indian, we should have basic kwelege about the what are rules and what are thigs we must do to get a development in India or state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;GROWTH IN ECONOMIC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The India by doing the this kind of development activtce the economic condition also will increce. If the India get`s development than forther economic condtions also wil get`s in a good condtion. that`s who clean India helping the economic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;SUGGESTION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 The gavernament of India must have to focuse on clean India &amp;nbsp;and make awareness among the people about the implimention of rules and regulation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
