&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Our pm has providing many faclities across india the one which my topic is related to trains which it has safe zone, less cost,reasonable,less time consuming.which it can help to develp the country.now a days technology has well develpoed to develop the country bullet trains which are not in range it is mainy in china,europanen countries but in india it has to be launched which economy can be developed because bullet trains &amp;nbsp;has high speed, quality,india has huge population which it can helpful to people in an better way and in an comportable way to reach their place .in which it provide very fast in nature compared to others transports.in india mainly to develop the technology with high speed as well less time consuming when comparted to others trains in any tranportation better convience has to be provide to public plays an important role in bullet trains having high technology, new innvoations,providing good facilities to people .bullet trains which consist of good &amp;nbsp;infrastured facilties having better convience to people with high technology as well as digital access throught technology.now a days IT plays an important role in any of situation. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has an huge population in thus cases bullet trains place an important role which it has high speed to reach the desnigation within a few hours when compared to others transports in an reasonable price which it mainly leads to develop the economy with high digitally access.an example metro trains has been launched in india with good infrastured faclity to provide better service to people in thus case the india can be have an good chance to develop the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better trains which has been already launched when compared to bullet trains it has high speed,technology access to reach the people in their desnigation in fraction of hours.the others has not a range to access thus faclities it takes time to reach the desnigation with less infrastured facality.now a days india has accessing new innvoations to develop &amp;nbsp;the economy with technology access .when comparation of bullet trains and normal trains having a good facalities like good infrastured,high speed,new technology,quality in bulklet trains. my suggestion is to launch bullet trains in india can have a better facilties to people by providing the service in an reasonable price and with high speed facality.which it can helpful to india to devlop the economy in an good enviroment.china has providing various products but now their is to importing from china any kind of products.which can be provided by ourselves in our own country.now a days india have launched digitally to access as well as new technology. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
