&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; INDIA has more population from all the countries. in INDIA it needs lots of changes from which most of the people life changes. It has huge population where there are mang rich people who becoming rich and rich as well as poor people becoming poorer and poorer also middle class people are in same position. i think INDIA needs educated people every child in INDIA should be educated and so that through them new technologies will be inventented also the country will be developed very soon. most of the people in the country even when there children are educated they are forcing their children to go abroad and do jobs and to study their. This should not happen in india when the child is born and bought up in this country he/she must develop this country he is a scientist or a doctor or many more. And india needs every child in our country should be educated to grow our nation and develop our nation in faster way.first thing that INDIA needs is that get rid of poor people i mean to say not by removeing them from country but giving proper education, houses etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Second thing that INDIA needs is politicians should be like helping the people and fulfilling their needs.And they should not be like taking off the people lands,not fulfilling their needs,etcmost of the politicians promise to do something in the elections time but they does`nt do after the elections have been completed. here is an example for you in the elections time they go to the slum areas begging for the vote and also they give the money for which people should vote them which is very much crime.They also promise the people that they build houses to them,but after the elections they don`t even come there and behave like they doen`t know them. not only this they also vacate the slum areas and promote to bulid the factories or industries,that`s why the poorer and becoming more poorrer. I think politicians must be like peoples wellwisher and for the people but not for their money and for their seat,and also politician should work for the people but not for the seat he has gained.I think most of the politicians in india are working for their money but not for the people so because of these politicians most of the people are suffering .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Third reason i would like to say is INDIA needs all the people should be settled with their jobs. In our country mostly people who have completed their studies are free not getting any jobs for example engineering students who are pass outs are now free nothing to do.so i think india needs this all the people who are educated need to do some or the other work. If they are &amp;nbsp;free there is no meaning to their study and to be free why they need to study. people should be working in one or other rather than doing nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Fourth need i would like to say is INDIA has the large population and there are many educated people who are searching for jobs but there are not enough companies to hire the people where all people in the country are set up in jobs. When there are not enough companies to hire then people would be doing nothing till they get a job.so i think there should to be more companies invented for the present people as well as the more people coming in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fifth need that is innovations should be made &amp;nbsp;in our country, by the people of our country not by others. like bullet trains which is the fastest train we can move from one place to another in the faster way and also we can change the rules of the country where the pople would be in disiplined manner and honest some of the people in INDIA dis honest and don`t have any respect towards people. The poples behaviour should change through these rules . And by the innovations in our country our economy or nation will be in the growth stage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;If any project is started in our country it should be in process till the project is completed . For example in past years say 2012 in telangana state it started the L&amp;amp;T project which was stopped due to some issues and it started recently. and don`t know how many years it goes on.so i think projects must be completed on time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="underline"&gt;&amp;nbsp;conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;: even if there are many needs in the country people does not say but they try to solve their own issues with the help of people who know them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
