<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3/12/2016 10:20:51 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making people aware is important, but more important is to convert awareness into action. Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Clean India", The present slogan or the title given to it "SWACH BHARATH". This "Swach Bharath" programme was started by our prime minister Shri Narendra Modi. The main motive of this movement is to make India one of the cleanest city in the world. Government have started taking all possible action to make the mission successful. The Government also promoting it in all possible ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Due to this programme started by the government many celebreties, MP`s, MLA`s and local leaders showing interest in looking up to their cities atleast once. In other case they hardly be seen in their hometown or the place ffrrom where they have been elected. But because of their interest, Even many households are trying to make the Swach Bharath mission successful in their own ways like starting from home, keeping their surroundings clean, cleaning up their colony premises at least once in a while or so, etc., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Government releasing funds alone will not make this programme successful, there are many employees in the municipality department who never turn up to work properly. All the officials should take the responsibility not for a day or so but for ever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The Programmes like SWACH BHARATH will be successful only when all the citizens feel it as a responsibility. Even today there are many cities, villages, colonies in our country which needs high literacy of cleanliness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In one way we are promoting all the programmes like SWACH BHARATH Orally, but when it comes to implementation part most of them don`t follow even at minimum level. The clean India movement cannot be achieved in a day. This needs a continuous progress, it should become a habit. Every citizen shoulod feel it as a reponsibility. All the representatives like MP`s And MLA`s should have a constant watch on such things. A single day working for it won`t fetch anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Educating based on the cleanlines &amp;nbsp;is required for all the illiterates as well as literates because all have an even sharae in making the country dirty, the only difference is few does the things unknowingly and the remaining knowingly. We do hear and see many times in news that the rural areas/villages are titled as the most cleanest places, it`s because they feel that the whole village is their own place which is meant to be kept celan as their home. This belongingness is needed for every person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Children are to be trained/taught to keep their surroundings clean, it doesn`t mean the home alone, it means the home, surroundings, colony city.... every place they move. This kind of belongingness is to be taught. Because many people do not mind littering their surroundings keeping their home alone clean.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Once all the practices of being clean are adopted and practiced India is going to be one of the cleanest countries in the world. Then the people across the globe will know the Indians not only for their attitude, culture, behavior and all but also for their cleanliness which is presently lacking in our country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
