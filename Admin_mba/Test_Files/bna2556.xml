Discuss three key factors for making `Make in India` a reality.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Make in India" is possible in practical, because in India therer is people who have lots of knowlwdge and skills. In India resources are available at low cost when compairing to other countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian people just need some good infrastructures and some investments for their Startups. Other countries` companies are coming in India open there branches here because here they will get more resources specially man resource at lower cost and also they have more knowledge and skills.&amp;nbsp; So, if the other countries can take the advantage of it, then if our goverment will think seriouslly about Make in India campgain it will be a succssefull campgain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian people are mostly known for their handy craft works. Places in India like Jammu and Kashmir, Varanasi, Asam are famous for the handy craft works. It can play a major role in Make in India campgain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the proper infrastucture new tchnologies and good education is provided to Indian people India can be a Manufacturing Hub. Indian government is working towards it. It is focusig more on all the issues related to this campgain, and trying to provide all the facilities which can make this capmgain succssefull. So "Make in India" is not just a dream, it is practically possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smart grid vandor landscape is undergoing for a period of change. In developed countries like North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Sevral larger vendors are now offering integrated solutions through the smart metering value chain, while communication and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, for improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energymanagement. Mean while, in emerging market countries like Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Rusia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia the market has just started growing. Dozens of local vedors has begainto serve the smart grid project, by both on their own as well as partners of larger international firms. A high growth rates projected for the smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents tyhe next frontier of vendors` avtivity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors, smaller and more fragmented local players will help in shaping the speed and directions of the smart grid developmet across the globe. This study take a coprehansive look at the trends for shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positionig themserlves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors who are already active in he smart grid projects across all over the regions in world. It highlights the growing regions and market segments, and assesses the exsiting partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions whyich are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries are investing in the smart grid project, the investment can reach $ 380.1 billion betwenn 2015 to 2025. Thius study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of hundred of vendors who are competing in this market.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market country in terms of smart grid development. With th fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to mordanize the county`s infrastuctre, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid market in the world by the end of the decade Brazil`s smart grid development has the product of stong underlying market conditions and positive government actions. Like many other emerging market countries, Brazil have highest rates of non- technical distribution losses, implying that utilities it will reap immediate revenue oprotectiopn benifits through smart meter deployments.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid market in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government actions. Like other emerging market countries, Brazil have high rates of non-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also have a rapidly growing economy, which begins the strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it was set as an non-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yet, some government officers and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be achieved, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;With strong underlying economic and political conditions, it is inevitable that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade. The question is simply how fast deployments will take place.

However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
