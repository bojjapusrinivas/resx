Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First thing that the people should be aware about the clean india movement because awareness is the imporatnt thing for understanding the given situation /topic . After the awareness process ,is it important for us to put that into action . Particular action should be taken by the people attitude of the person places a major role because it is based on their thinking and behaviour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;AWARENESS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; what is all about awareness??? awarenesss is nothing but giving sufficient information to the public that &amp;nbsp;is we should expalin what is the scheme all about , advantages and disadvantages of the particular scheme . Then only the people will be in a position to promote the scheme further or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;CLEAN INDIA MOVEMENT :&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This is the new type of the scheme where our prime minister" NARENDRA MODI " want to promote in India. His idea was to make our" DIGITAL INDIA " more innovative and adorable. In this process he thought of something about clean india . First after making sufficient awareness , we should convert this into Action.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; creating awareness may be in the form of delivering &amp;nbsp;presentations to the public who live cities and towns , and for the village people they can conduct some camps for the better understanding because they ll not be in a postion to understand presentations and all , that is the reason we should educate them by giving live examples , they should also have sufficient knowledge to promote the scheme.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Clean india movement is the movement , where they concentrate more on the cleanliness of our country. we have a famous proverb in english saying that &lt;span class="bold"&gt;"CLEANILESS IS NEXT TO GODLINESS".&lt;/span&gt; &amp;nbsp;So inorder to prove this they have started a scheme called clean india movement. This movement is all about cleanliness, if we keep our environment clean and neat , then the people around us also will not effected by the environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ROADS in india are not clean and neat , inorder to make them &amp;nbsp;clean an neat the government and public should take initiatives. &amp;nbsp;Government should play a major role in this movement , because it is the one which provides the sufficient funds to develop the scheme , getting funds is not only the thing with that we should give awareness to the public , telling them the advantages and disadvantages of the scheme .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Public are the next players in promoting the scheme , without them there is no possibility of getting the things done. PEOPLE in india are &amp;nbsp;of different kinds : extroverts and introverts , they tastes and preferences differ ,their needs and wants may also differ , so &amp;nbsp;it is difficult for handle these people . so whlie creating awareness we should keep all this type of people in mind , and according to that we should create awareness . The main this is that we should motivate people by telling the advantages of the clean india .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The attitude and behaviour of the people differ according bto that awareness should be made where all people can afford &amp;nbsp;to take inititative.like keeping dustbins in and around the houses, and a particular bin inn each colony so that all the wastes can be dumped into that and those bins should be disposed at the end of the dy so that the people in and around willl not be affected by the diseases,for doing all this the person should be intrested in doing the things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;ATTITUDE is the major part where the people take the things into consideration. YES!!!!!&amp;nbsp;Right&amp;nbsp;attitude of the people is important to change them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
