Suggest measures to be taken by the government to fine-tune the digital payment/cashless economy.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; "Demonetization is nothing but changes of currency".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;In india demonetization(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;change the currency)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;has occured in 2017 in the month of November meanwhile the decisions has been taken by central ministers mainly to stop the black money and political issues. This changes can help the public not to keep the currency with them and to carry for everything. Government has came into existence with the applications like paytm, internet banking etc...&amp;nbsp; Demonetisation placed a change to bank customers on more use of swiping cards like debit and credit cards and carrying the cuurency using the cheques. Why this actually happend because to make India DIGITAL and to develop India economically. As follows the measures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;1. yes,demonetize old notes it is good because to get people aware about digital cashless use, to avoid black money and political issues during the elections.even it may helps to stop the corruption.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;2. As we all know everyone is using smart phones and from family even one person may using smartphones and they were compulsary aware about use of data for internet , so using the particular applications for cashless payments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3. we use cash to save for future savings,payments &amp;amp;etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;4. For payments know a days there is no need to carry cash by using the applications like paytm, we can pay through paytm from respective person a/c to particular paytm a/c.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;5. After demonetization there is a lack of problem to provide the currency notes to bank customers and others due to less currency printing by RBI govt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;6. Cashless economy was came in to existence for to make and aware of the people who handling the cash. Instead of using the curreny notes for everything like payments and all digital cashless is the best way like internet banking to avoid the extra charges on using swiping cards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;7. About digital payments , the best application is PAYTM for every smartphone users to avoid the risk of carrying cash, theift, extra charges on swiping cards, changes of currency, using more cash and handling high usage of carrying cash for every payment. Here we can use this kind of applications to avoid risky factors on using cash. For Digital payments we can login to application and can approach were ever we need and to pay particular amount.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;8. As every country is going on digitally to avoid the risk on return and making country to be fast as per the trend looking for benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;9. mostly, govt is looking for changes in public as per the trend and awareness on to avoid risk factors by digital payments / cashless economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;10. Digital payments/ cashless economy is typical and similar but the way of measuring to use in different aspects to develop the economic growth in&amp;nbsp;India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;11. Most important thing is that Every change should have to follow and utilise by the people which govt is looking for there change and awareness to not get loss on there assets.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms. With high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors and smaller, more fragmented local players will help shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. This study takes a comprehensive look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positioning themselves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across all regions of the world, highlights growing regions and market segments, and assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions that are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries, smart grid investment will reach $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. This study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of the hundreds of vendors competing for this growing market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development. With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action. Like many emerging market countries, Brazil has high rates of non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also has a rapidly growing economy, which is beginning to strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it&amp;nbsp; set a non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However,&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; August&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2012, the&amp;nbsp; government&amp;nbsp; announced&amp;nbsp; an&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;opt--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;in&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meter&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; regulation&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; customers,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Paired with&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; requiring&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; new&amp;nbsp; customers.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp; was&amp;nbsp; not&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; anticipated&amp;nbsp; market&amp;nbsp; catalyst&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; those&amp;nbsp; expecting&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; binding&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; replace&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million existing legacy&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; result,&amp;nbsp; Northeast&amp;nbsp; Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its initial 63 million smart meter target. Yet, some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be achieved, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;With strong underlying economic and political conditions, it is inevitable that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade. The question is simply how fast deployments will take place. Through a combination of new meter installations, smart meters targeted at reducing non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt; technical losses, and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications, more than half of Brazilian homes will have smart meters by the end of the decade. However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
