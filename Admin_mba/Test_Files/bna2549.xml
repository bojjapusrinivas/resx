Discuss three key factors for making `Make in India` a reality.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Making India is a&amp;nbsp; programme introduced my our honourable prime minister Mr.Narendar Modi in India.This program was introduced to encourage manufactures in India..Make in india stand up india was the scheme name the name itself depicts that when manfacturing own products increases in India it leads to economic development and increase the revenue this will help to reduce the value of imports from other countries.Making india is an oppourtunity to a person given to exhibit their business idea and can establish their own manufacturing unit.This scheme provides a&amp;nbsp; number of facilities like incubator centers and even provide some financial loans to those people who are in need of money to establish their business idea.Making india scheme helps the small and medium vendors to manufacture the goods in India so that there is no need of importing goods from other countries.This scheme was introduced to help the manufactures in india and to produce the products and sell them in india.Many products are imported in india from various countries like china,japan etc due to this the gross national income of india is reducing and this is leading to inflation and many other factorsin order&amp;nbsp; to reduce all these factors prime minister Narendra modi has intoduced this scheme .This scheme is like a hub to all the manufactures in india to manufacture their goods,products and to sell them in India using various distribution channels.Making India is considered as a dream until some possible measures are&amp;nbsp; taken it can practically work out when some measures like following are taken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)All the imported products in india must be abolished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;2)The raw materials requried for manfacturing various products must be made available even to small and medium scale manufactures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)We should not allow china products to sell in india.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4)Government should encourage the manufactures to sell thier products by their own distribution channel in india.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5)Government should provide loans to the manufactures at lower interest rates which helps them in producing goods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;6)Goods should be produced at low cost than the cost incured to import them from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;GLOBAL SMART GRID VENDOR LANDSCAPE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Smart Grid vendor landscape is a smart meter value chain .It helps in eliminating risk involved electromechanical meters in value chain.When compared to developed countries&amp;nbsp; like North America ,Europe and East Asia developing countries like Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe Eurasia Latin America the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa,South Asia,the Southern Asia markets are still emerging and are back using smart metres.Many of the local vendors are serving with smart grid metres by themselves or by making partnership with other international firms.The high results from smart vendor grid projects&amp;nbsp; created oppourtunities .The study made on the growing dynamics of growing and consolidated international smart grid vendors local players will help for deployment of smart&amp;nbsp; grid across the globe.This study results in trends of shaping the smart grid vendors and how they are leading towards sucess.The study says that already 500 vendors are using smart metrics which represents growing market segments and there is a view that investment in smart grid may reach upto $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025.This study depicts that hundred of vendors competing for growing markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRAZALIAN SMART GRID MARKET&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Brazil is the fifth largest population country in the world and it is one of the country emerging with the smart grid wIth government support.Brazil is very signifcant smart metric market for both marketers and suppliers.It is a technically driven country and it can easily earn profits using smart grid meters.As the economy growing rapidly in brazil the government has took a notice that to replace 63 existing electromechanical meters with the smart meters by 2021.In august 2012 the government announced to opt smart meter regulation for existing customer and new&amp;nbsp; smart meters for new customers.The north east group has forcasted that the braZil will not reach its 63 million initial goal but the Brazil government was in espectation that it will reach its initial goal which will result in future incentive structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;With an underlying assumptions of political and economical conditions it is sure that it will grow with smart grid landscape.With the implementation of smart meter and new meter implementations it is reducing the non technical lossess too.Even the customers are enthusiastic to take advantage of smart grid.Brazil will have half of its homes with smart metres by the end of the decade. As per the study it reflects that August 2012 regulation fell short in meeting requiements for Brazil to meet its initial goal of 63 million smart meters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms. With high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors and smaller, more fragmented local players will help shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. This study takes a comprehensive look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positioning themselves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across all regions of the world, highlights growing regions and market segments, and assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions that are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries, smart grid investment will reach $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. This study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of the hundreds of vendors competing for this growing market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market &amp;ndash; An Insight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development. With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action. Like many emerging market countries, Brazil has high rates of non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also has a rapidly growing economy, which is beginning to strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it&amp;nbsp; set a non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;However,&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; August&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2012, the&amp;nbsp; government&amp;nbsp; announced&amp;nbsp; an&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;opt--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;in&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meter&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; regulation&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; customers,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Paired with&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; requiring&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; new&amp;nbsp; customers.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp; was&amp;nbsp; not&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; anticipated&amp;nbsp; market&amp;nbsp; catalyst&amp;nbsp; for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; those&amp;nbsp; expecting&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; binding&amp;nbsp; mandate&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; replace&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million existing legacy&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; result,&amp;nbsp; Northeast&amp;nbsp; Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its initial 63 million smart meter target. Yet, some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the initial goal can be achieved, which may inspire future incentive structures and more favorable smart metering regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;With strong underlying economic and political conditions, it is inevitable that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid market will grow significantly in the coming decade. The question is simply how fast deployments will take place. Through a combination of new meter installations, smart meters targeted at reducing non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt; technical losses, and customers eager to take advantage of advanced smart grid applications, more than half of Brazilian homes will have smart meters by the end of the decade. However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
