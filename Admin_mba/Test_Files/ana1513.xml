What has been the performance of small states that were carved out previously from large states? Have they fulfilled the demands of the people or is it just plain power politics at play? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Today,s the Indian democracy is completely depends on politics. In india small states is need but not in all states its depends up on the people. Some places(lands) is completely agriculturic lands. So we dont need converyt those lands for buildings and any other development for to state development divided in to small states. The major drawback is in large state is employement. Why because we all have seen that people working in government sectors came from other places. So the thing will changes like 1st preference to in bound candidates. And even any industry located in some X location they will provied some more percentage of employment in that area. So any of this kind of things happend in india no need state separation. The small states are performing is depends on the political memeber who is there. The state member is make the performing is good by his way of developing. Small states need more long time to perform good. Some times the people didnt fullfilled their demands what they have and what they need.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Some more places small states are carved out from large states by politics play. They even have the good in this to make from large states. In small state the people also even support to government for bit of long time to perform well. But in india most of the things are happend through political play. Some times it may useful to people and some times its lost. In this play most of them are self incomed. Even some more states they dnt&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
