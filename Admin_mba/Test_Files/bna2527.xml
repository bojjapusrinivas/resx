&lt;p&gt;Cashless economy is the most important plan initiated recently by Shri Narendra Modi (Prime Minister) of India as a part of Digitilization. It was popularized after the demonitization of the denominations 500 &amp;amp; 1000.As several online payment service providers made profits as mostly everyone used the services for payments and doing transactions. As&amp;nbsp; India is a developing country and becoming technically advanced after Europeon &amp;amp; Russian countries. Its objective is to reduce the cash in hand process for buying &amp;amp; selling, payments, transfers etc,. It is the best plan to go cashless by making the trasactions with Debit&amp;nbsp; &amp;amp; Credit cards, bank transfers, cheques etc.,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;PROS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;gt; Time and energy saving for people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;gt; Fast payments through online services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;gt; No need of carrying cash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;gt; Making the efficient use of technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;gt; Self checking and self payments with user ID and password..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&amp;gt; 24/7 process without the concern of banking hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Reduces paper work and burden for bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Transfers huge amount in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Helps the people to check their bank accounts and statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Will have several offers for trasfers and payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;CONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Problem for people in rural areas as some are uneducated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Reach of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Network and server issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Threat of cyber crimes &amp;amp; hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; User ID and passwork problems &amp;amp; errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Not getting text for transactions made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Problems for making hand payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SECURITY FOR DIGITAL PAYMENTS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cashless economy is important&amp;nbsp; for each &amp;amp; every country in present sceanario for the development of the country as technology is developing rapidly in day to day life. To be a part of development it is important for India to go cashless. It will be problem for the users in rural areas as they are not aware of the technology, problems of illiteracy etc,. Security for the cashless payments are somehow reliable but not very secured as there are several problems with the cashless economy for the country such as people in rural areas, technology &amp;amp; security issues, servers and networks problems, frauds by some intermediaries in between. Government should takecare of all the issues facing by the users, developing various technologies, creating awareness among the people and encouraging them for cashless economy. Thus the cashles economy is a part of developed countries and helps in being front in the competative environment and building a good society. Trust and secure is another issue concerned with the cashless transactions or payments. Many people who use the services have trust and feels like it is secure but there are chances where cash will be trasfered from the accounts with prior information, credited to various accounts by hacking. Indian economy is huge and developing rapidly concerned to the technology. There will be trasactions concerned with huge amount from one person to other and from one company to other. Thus it may cause problems for the government in different ways with the security issues as people who are making cyber crimes are also using different and latest technologies which helps in keeping the data confidential and secure in terms. there will be less chances for the government to detect them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to me, there are several benefits as well as security issues with the cashless economy. It is secure to the extent but there are many chances that it will also have problems with the cashless economy. It crates fear and people will stop making the cashless payments and transactions if something goes wrong. thus it will also effect the economy of the country as it is huge. Sometimes it also creates issue for the foreign companies for invesments for the develpoment of the country and lack of trust for transfer of amount. Government has to take several steps to solve the issues and to create awareness among people regarding the use before going for cashless economy. Cashless economy helps the country in development &amp;amp; to be part of digitalization. Helps to be in&amp;nbsp; good position interms cocerned to the use of technology and government to make things simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a modern world, the smart elevator plans are moving fastly. It generates revenues for the countries and their economy with plans of high-level projects across the world by 2020. China the country which is first in terms of population is moving fast in smart elevator market accounts 53% roughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development among the countires around the world and huge construction plans created demand for the elevator market for good and safe transportation system.it is acquring importance in new projects infrastructures and current infrastructures as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several developed countries like US, UK. Canada, France have made important contributions to smart elevator market revenues. In future the high- rise bulings will obviously have plans deployment of smart elevators and it will generate huge revenues for the countries and will contribute nearly 52% of overall market revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced technology in the world helps satisfying the needs of the customers in various segments like commercial, institutions, companies, helathcare, hospitality among others. Plans for the smart elevators will be customized as per the requirements of the people like time saving, availability, security, control, sepcial space for visitors and good parking facilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage of the people living in cities has increased rapidly from 34% in 1960 to 54% in 2014. Due to modernization and technology development there will be increase in the cities population by 1.8% every year during 2015-20. The limitation of space or area in cities will result in high projects and leads to the demand for smart elevators for&amp;nbsp;transportation and convenience of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendors across the global are focusing on smart elevators for competition in the market. ThyssenKrupp&amp;nbsp;vendor in elevators which maintains and manages 1.1 million elevators is working on the issues to improve the quality of the service. In 2014 Schindler Elevatro Corporation installed modern PORT elevator technology at Union Plaza office bulding in Puerto Rico. thus htere are several other places like Hearst Tower, Bank of America in Manhattan, Humana headquarters and Crescent in Dallas where they installed smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several commercial applications of smart elevators are hospitals, institutions, offices, hotels, multiplexes. the design of the elevators will be different comapared to others. The capacity and space will also vary among diffrenet application areas as per needs and requirements. Mostly in malls and multiplexes good technology is necessary for fast moving people and purpose of elevator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the use of technology of smart elevator systems consumes huge power or electricity for working fastly and smoothly. The important and related players in the market are working to find out solutions for elevators with less use and to reduce the electricit (smart elevators).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011 Mitsubishi has developed a multi level elevator technology which reduced the power consumption up to 10%. Smart technology is focused to worh efficiently in the demand and peak time and reducing the power in normal hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
