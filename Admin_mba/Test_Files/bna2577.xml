Suggest measures to be taken by the government to fine-tune the digital payment/cashless economy.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yes, it is an initiative taken by Prime minister.NARENDRA MODI on november,08,2016.The term Demonitization refers to "changes in people`s money".Demontization is done to eradicate the black money or money earned through illegal activities.As the decision&amp;nbsp; was&amp;nbsp; taken very quickly, common people had suffered alot.The decision was changing of old 500 &amp;amp; 1000 notes.Here are&amp;nbsp; some of the&amp;nbsp; advantages&amp;nbsp; and disadvantages of demonitization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PROS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Demontization is done to stop corruption in country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.To avoid using black money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.To make Digital India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.To know the tax avoiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Common people had to stand in que`s for hours`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian Smart Grid Market- AN Insight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is one of the leading market country in terms of smart grid development.It will become one of the largest&amp;nbsp; smart grid markets in the world by the end of decade.It is the country which is in 5th place,largest population in the world with a government that is ready to&amp;nbsp; modernize the country`s infrastrucuture.Brazil smart grid development is a product with strong&amp;nbsp; market conmditions&amp;nbsp; and positive government actons.This country has high rates of non technical distribution losses implying utilities will reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments.It has also growing economy which is begin to strain existing infrastructure.As the country grow,the reliability and energy saving benifits of smart grid will become important.The Brazil government has taken notice in 2009 to set&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp; non binding target replacing all 63 million existing electromechanical meters with smart meters by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Augest 2012, the government has announced an "opt--in" smart meter regulation for existing customers,paired with a mandate requiring smart meters for new customers.This is not anticipated market catalyst for those expecting a bind mandate to replace all 63 millions legacy meters with smart meters.Northeast group is currently forecasting that Brazil will not reach its intial 63 million smart meter target.Some government officials and regulators are still optimistic that the intial goal can be acheived,which may inspire&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;future&amp;nbsp; incentive structure and more regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With strong economic and political condition, it is inevitable that brazil smart grid market will grow in future.But the question is how fast deployments will takes place?A combination of new meter will installation,smart grid meters target at reducing non tecnical loss and customers eager t take adavantage of advanced smart grid applications more than half of brazilian homes will have smart meters in future.However,the august 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate need for Brazil to meet its goal of 63 million meters by 2021.Brazil will remains asignificant smart grid market for both vendors and customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Global Smart Grid Vendor Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The smart grid vendor landscape is undergoing a period of change. In developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, markets are maturing and vendors are consolidating. Several of the larger vendors now offer integrated solutions throughout the smart metering value chain, while communications and data analytics providers are increasingly active across multiple smart grid segments, improving the coordination between smart metering, distribution automation and home energy management. Meanwhile, in emerging market countries &amp;ndash; across Africa, Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia &amp;ndash; the market is just beginning to grow. Dozens of local vendors have begun to serve smart grid projects, both on their own and as partners of larger international firms. With high growth rates projected for smart grid projects in emerging market countries, this represents the next frontier of vendor activity and opportunity. The dynamics between growing and consolidating international smart grid vendors and smaller, more fragmented local players will help shape the speed and direction of smart grid deployments across the globe. This study takes a comprehensive look at the trends shaping the smart grid vendor landscape and how firms are positioning themselves to succeed. It includes over 500 vendors already active in smart grid projects across all regions of the world, highlights growing regions and market segments, and assesses the existing partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions that are altering the smart grid market. Across 125 countries, smart grid investment will reach $380.1 billion between 2015 and 2025. This study presents a picture of the competitive landscape of the hundreds of vendors competing for this growing market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Brazil is already one of the leading emerging market countries in terms of smart grid development. With the fifth largest population in the world and a government that is eager to modernize the country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, Brazil will become one of the largest smart grid markets in the world by the end of the decade. Brazil&amp;rsquo;s smart grid development is the product of strong underlying market conditions and positive government action. Like many emerging market countries, Brazil has high rates of non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;technical distribution losses, implying&amp;nbsp; that utilities&amp;nbsp; will&amp;nbsp; reap immediate revenue protection benefits through smart meter deployments. Brazil also has a rapidly growing economy, which is beginning to strain existing infrastructure. As&amp;nbsp; the country continues to grow, the reliability and&amp;nbsp; energy savings benefits of smart grid will become increasingly important. The Brazilian government has&amp;nbsp; taken notice and in 2009 it&amp;nbsp; set a non--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Cambria Math&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;#8208;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;binding target of replacing&amp;nbsp; all&amp;nbsp; 63&amp;nbsp; million&amp;nbsp; existing&amp;nbsp; electromechanical&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; with&amp;nbsp; smart&amp;nbsp; meters&amp;nbsp; by&amp;nbsp; 2021.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, the August 2012 regulations fell short of the concrete mandate needed for Brazil to meet it&amp;rsquo;s original goal of 63 million meters by 2021. Nonetheless, Brazil remains a very significant smart grid market for both vendors and customers alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
