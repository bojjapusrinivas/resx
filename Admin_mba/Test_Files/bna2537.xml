&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;According to my view sometimes digital payments are not secure enough for the Indian economy to go cashless because all the digital payments should be linked with the Adharcard and compulsory KYC should be done where some people may do it . With this digital payments when we need to tranfer money from paytm to bank its including extra charges to complete the transaction each an everytime. Due to this there will be a loss to the common people and profit to that particular digital paymnts apps. Not all the people may have digital payments to do their payments whenever necessary. Some people may have some may not have so its better to go with cash. Now-a-days each an every shop is using digital payments, if we buy even a chocolate or a small thing they ask us to do paytm bt each an every person can`t have that have facility to do because all are not educated . Using cash payment is better than all other digital payments were we do not get loss nor profit. If we use this digital payments for each an everything one day this whole Indian economy goes cashless were we cant see even a ten rupees note in this economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; With this digital payments most of the low class people and the farmers get suffered because they can`t afford all these type of facilities and they even don`t know how to use these apps because they are not educated. So, it`s better to use use cash system in this Indian economy were most of the people are comfortable with this. Some people may do not have cash in their digital apps to pay the amount at a particular place then what will be situation of that particular person. Rarely people will use this digital payments in our Indian economy. Most of the people are comfortable with cash system only. If we ask any one of our friends or family members to give cash when we are in need or if it`s too urgent they answer will be sorry no cash can i do paytm . For each an everything if we use these digital payments there will be no cash in this Indian economy. With this digital payments in our next generation i guess there will be no cash at lot in this huge Indian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

China alone is 53% of the upcoming projects around the world. With this existing elevator systems the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. All the high level buildings are demanding for fast,comfortable,efficient and secure vertical transportation system.These conventional elevator systems are developed in countries sush as U.S, UK, Canada and France are the major contributors to smart elevator market revenue. the smart elevator systems should have advanced features and integration of intellegent communication,access control and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;security technology. It enables the smart elevators to cater the customer needs of various end use segments such as residential,commercial,healthcare,industrial and hospitality and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Smart elevators can provide excellent reliability,hygiene,aesthetics,ride and destination control,space and comfort.There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014 the urban population was 54% of the total world population when compared to 34% in 1960. The global vendors of vertical transportation systemare currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. The smart elevators are being used for offices,hotel&amp;amp;lodgings,healthcare,financial institutions and retail(malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of all the elevators differ in all the sectors.The elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator. Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial areas and buildings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
