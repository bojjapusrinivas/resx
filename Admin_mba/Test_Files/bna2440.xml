&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;I think Better trains are needed for India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;As we know the India economy is developing in fastest pace and India which has entered into various fields all over world. And coming to advance technology used in India there are many loop holes , which may not ensure the accurate results. . As our country has a good railway system which truly ensures to provide good and safety transportation to people, it lacks in many aspects. Now a days they&amp;nbsp;are not even providing the minimum facilities to the passengers such as bookings, seat conformations , electricity in the trains, sanitation, food and safety measuers to common people . And thinking of having Bullet trains is insane.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;As&amp;nbsp;people in India mostly prefer trains to reach far destinations even though it doesnot have the minimum facilities but it is cheap and everyone can afford. Its better to improve the local trains in India rather than going to bullet trains , as they consume more electricity, have to construct new infrastucture, have expertise people who can operate and resolve problems causing in future, and coming to train accidents in India there many people losing their lives. It would be diffcult to old people while travelling as we see in many foreign countries the people meet with accidents during boarding the train or at depature as the door closes within few minutes it is difficult to get down from&amp;nbsp;the crowd in the train. Bullet trains help in minimizing &amp;nbsp;the travelling distance and time, but it cannot be afforded by common people as they have to charge more fares than the local trains, and speed at which it travels is three times more than the local trains which lead to accidents . I think it is best suited for travelling far places in foreign countries rather than in India , as local trains have stations at every 5-6 kms where people living in near places can travel easily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;And it also has a major impact on the budget , by providing extra money and spending more money for the infrastucture , labour, advance technology, as it also occupies large acres of land to construct as their are many residental areas and also highways in between main and far destination points, and also their are many restrictions from common people which would distrub their livelihood and it is only suited for the high class people who travel once a while as they as having thier own vechiles to travel and even the airway transport facilities are also afforded by them. But coming to common people they cannot afford and they do prefer to local trains. The pollution from tthe Bullet trains it dangerous to health which realease hazardous gases which are absorbed in the air by polluting the enivornment around and also causing harmful diseases to people .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;As Indian Railways are providing many types of trains , such as Metro Rails which are &amp;nbsp;more better than local trains providing many facilities to people by using advance technology and also providing employment to engineers in India.I would conclude that better trains as much better than bullet trains and think better trains are needed for India rather than bullet trains as they both of them are having pros and cons. I would suggest to improve the ones we have now and request Indian Railways Department to take due measure to provide best facilites to common people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
