&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;According to my view, I think that bullet trains are better than our normal trains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The best advantage of it that it saves our time and it is also cost saving when compared with other fastest means of transporattion. &amp;nbsp;Usually we notice that our normal trains found to be always delayed due to some reason or the other. They are mainly used to travel a long distance in a short span of time and in adequatew cost so that a normal middle claas person can afford it. But instead of reaching on time to our deeparture we mostly find that due to some or the other factors we get delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to me India ia vast country with many knowledge persons like different engineers, managers etc. If appropriate chance &amp;amp; platform is given to these people we can observe a vast &amp;nbsp;huge change in our country growing economically and getting developed. We find that in India there a huge population and people are travelling from one place to another while performing their job. Sometimes, it is also seem that people rush one place to place to otherin order to save their time. They try to choose a better means of transporattion so that they reach their destination on time and with the less cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in India, we find that there are many middle class people who trying to save their money in some aspect or the other so that that savings would help them in futrure to their children or at their oldage. Mostly, we can find this type of thinking of saving money for future use in every individual in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, acoording to my point of view India does needs&amp;nbsp;a bullet trains than a better trains. From an individual point of view, it saves the time and also the cost. From the country point, we can say that it can be used to increase the economy of our country. As the bullet trains has many &lt;span class="bold"&gt;advantages&lt;/span&gt; like....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. It become one of the fastest means of transportation with better cost affordale by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Fuel, disel, gas, etc can be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Many worthy engineers, designers, managers, will get job opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. It help the youth to come up with their ideas at various fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Foreigners can attracted to visit our country if they find such type of new facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. It can one of the means by which we can distinguish that our country is also a developing country with growiing economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing that I want to tell u here is that bullet trains are really a very good means of transportation as our Prime Minister NARENDRA&amp;nbsp;MODI is also trying to imlement this in our country. He has visited various countries all around the nation and he has found the imporatnce and need for Bullet trains. He always mention in his speech that he is going to provide changes in various sectors and also giving job opportunity to the youth. With the growing speed of our Prime minister work we can very soon find our country with such type of innovation in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, in our country people use trains for many purpose like to travel short distance i.e., within a span of time. To move goods from one place to other which also act as a logistics in dielivering of the products. Gas, disel etc are also moved from one place to other with the help of trains as it is a convenient way to send it. People use trains to travel long distance i.e., when a person want to travel from north to south he prefers trains than other means because it is cost effective and also luxurious so that they can realx sleep eat and go on easily. But all such facilities are not provioded in bullet trains as there are only meant to travel sjort distances . It is rarely seen that a Bullet trains travel a long distances that is., for more tha two days as such( more than 30 hours).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But according to my view, there are many many talented enginners, managers, etc who are having various skills in different fields in our country. lack of opportunity to prove themselves their talent is being hiddden by themselves only. If given a chance Indians can do wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that Indians those are rich go for futher studies to abroad and get settled their itself. Mostly, in US, Singapore and such countires they find the living style is good and also their talent is given opportunity. they grow themselves at a faster speed when compared when being in India. So according to my view, our country should come up with various schemes which help our country to grow more along with providing job oppoprtunity to the one who has different skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this it would be easy to make sure that our country can grow and come up with new findings, techniques and innovations such as bullet trains which is mostly important in&amp;nbsp;this present scenario. These trains will ease the human being to reach the destination on time with less cost. It can also be a pride for us when we trave in such trains which makes us feels that we are in other country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, i would like conclude by saying that in one line that Bullet Trains gives us an immense satisfaction with all the other benefits to the one who is using it and also to the one who are performing and working on it along with the country.&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
