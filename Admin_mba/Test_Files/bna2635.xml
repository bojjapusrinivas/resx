&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Single use plastic ban is a controversy that is happening now in India mainly in Telangana State to bring the balance between the economy and the environment.Actually the intiation for plastic ban has took years ago across the world but it is not followed seriously by the manufactures and the users .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;But due to deterioration of environment the government made strict rules to impose fines on the sellers so that the sales decreases and the users also gets awareness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;As the polycarbon doesnot decompose quickly and takes years it is harmful for human beings plants and animals.It ruins the environment and reduces the oxygen content slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;But the plastic usage is very high and adding a huge profits to the economy so most of the companies are not letting down the business .The manufacturers are selling plastic in the form of bags,cups, bottles and boxes etc. The consumers are also showing high interest to purchase the plastic products due to low price and for its easy reusage.Single usage is not harmful for customers but problem comes in the decomposition process.But the customers are also not restrictin g to the single usage and going for reusage which reduces the economy as well as the consumers health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;The plastic is to be banned completely avoiding in manufacturing of some important products .The government should strictly impose the fines and the users should be aware of avoiding plastic which is good for environment.The government should advertise and create awareness so the consumers avoids using plastic and the manufactures will reduce there supply and eventually stops supplying.These measures can bring balance between the economy and the environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
