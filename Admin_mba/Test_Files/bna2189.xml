Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, making people aware is important and at the same time converting that awareness into action is equally important. Once people get to know what exactly is happening, they will be in a position to put that into action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;These days many of us have come across the movement called Clean India which is also known as Swatch Bharath. It is the movement started by Prime Minister of India. He is the first person to start that awareness among people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Initially, a few supported the idea and came forward to make our country Clean and Green. Especially, people who are from urban area created awareness among others so that they can spread the idea of keeping our country clean. With a lot of campaigning started by political leaders, social workers, students, employees, social media etc.. it slowly moved from urban areas to rural areas and even reached people from small villages. This shows that they succeded in creating awareness and now time has come to put that into action which is difficult among all the tasks. Leaders thought that, it should not be like just spreading the word, it should be like taking an initiative and come forward to do their best. If everyone thinks in a that way and feel responsible to keep our country clean then definitely it becomes an attitude of an individual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Yes, attitude change more important than the movement. &amp;nbsp;Actually, now we can observe people with that attitude who thinks that it is part of their daily life to keep their city clean. Not only elders but also children are actively contributing their part for Clean India. Even we can see people who are planning a day apart from their working days to clean their surroundings. &amp;nbsp;Finally, this shows that they are moving towards success in attaining Clean India. So, if such innovative ideas are encouraged then India becomes one of the developed countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
