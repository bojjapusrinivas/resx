What has been the performance of small states that were carved out previously from large states? Have they fulfilled the demands of the people or is it just plain power politics at play? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;For a developing country like India, I don&amp;#39;t think we really need smaller states in order to progress the nation. After Independence , there were only 18 states which gradually over the course of time have reached to 27 states which includes the latest newly formed&amp;nbsp;state named &amp;quot; Telengana&amp;quot; which was formed in May 2014.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Splitting a state into further smaller states is not the correct solution to make the country progress. By creating smaller states out of the larger states won&amp;#39;t really going to help the nation moving towards the progress rather it decrease the progress I say. It&amp;#39;s will be useful for the politicians only or else smaller state is not going to be beneficial to any other. In the past we have seen the formation of smaller states from the larger state&amp;nbsp;like Uttrakhand &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Chattishghar. There has been hardly any change in the progress of the nation after the formation of those smaller states. Creation of such smaller states have increased the use of resources like money, funds, corruption, loans from World Bank. They create an imbalance in the society, in the mind of citizen which hamper India&amp;#39;s progress.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;For example, the formation of newly elected state Telengana would have brought happiness, smile, relief&amp;nbsp;to the people of Telengana state but the actually scenario which took place behind the screen in the formation of the state hardly matters to anyone. There was a huge loss in term of property , government transport, student&amp;#39;s life, school &amp;amp; college were closed for months and months, manpower, infrastructure. Many public transport were destroyed, set to fire, many died, government and private building were destroyed. Who is to be blamed and held responsible for all of it. No one can say that it was for the India to progress. So after such a huge loss to mankind, does the formation of new state would really going to help in the progress of Nation ? I really don&amp;#39;t think so.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We Indians are known for &amp;quot;Unity in Diversity&amp;quot;. But that really doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we keep on creating new smaller state. There have been already so much of diversification, we don&amp;#39;t need more complicated. The performance of small states that were carved out earlier from large state were not satisfactory. They failed to fulfilled the demands of the people. As per my opinion it was just politics at play for their beneficial. We Indians are emotional fools and theses political leader know how to play with it and utilize it to its fullest. Before the formation of new smaller state, the politicians make huge promises to the public and once formed it hardly matter to them and no one even bother to stand against them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;For India to progress in actual manner, one should target the real problems&amp;nbsp;which hamper the progress . Problems like poverty, employment, food, education, corruption are the real cause which stops India from progressing so just by crating more smaller states from the larger one is not going to make India progressive.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
