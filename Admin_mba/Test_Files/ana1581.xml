To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;I completely agree with the above statement, that mass media including television, radio, newspapers have great influence in shaping people&amp;#39;s ideas. In the last few years there has been a vast development in this field, and today&amp;nbsp;almost every house has a television and every&amp;nbsp;company, hotels etc have computers to make their work a lot easier. Due to the rapid development of&amp;nbsp;mass media, every person&amp;nbsp;from a child to the old are exposed to the&amp;nbsp;world of knowledge which earlier was very limited.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The exposure through mass media in today&amp;#39;s world may be constructive and also destructive.&amp;nbsp; Firstly I would like to give a glimpse of how can the mass media be constructive.&amp;nbsp;Computers have played a vital role in shaping the growth of the students which will help them in preparing their project works, by just sitting at home&amp;nbsp;they acquire more knowledge pertaining to their respective subjects. In this fast paced world one cannot do without computers in any field, be it railways, companies, educational institutions etc. And newspapers the old form of mass media and&amp;nbsp;just at a glance through it, you have the whole world news. Radio which once was a very important source of Information on current affairs, Entertainment&amp;nbsp;etc before the arrival of the televisions and computers. Now-a-days we also have radio on our Mobile phones too.&amp;nbsp;Also Mobile Phones are playing a vital role in people&amp;#39;s lives, just a hit on the button you get to know everything you want to where ever you are. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Television the perfect source of entertainment, news, for the people of all ages. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;It is also destructive in many ways if not used for good purposes. They say every coin has 2 sides, so the mass media has also few loopholes. Like for example, televisions is a mere source of entertainment but now-a-days especially children are getting hooked on to it for many hours than needed and neglect their studies which is very bad. And today&amp;#39;s youth are getting more Influenced by movies, Daily soaps and they tend to become aggressive, violent and negative in their real lives not knowing that there is a great gap between reel and the reality. And more people are getting addicted to all the social networking sites which may lead them in the wrong path. And they are always on to their mobile phones and computers and tend to neglect people around them. There are also may crimes reported on the Web. Many at times people are cheated as there is no transparency in the transactions made.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Hence I would like to conclude that the mass media is really a boon if used appropriately.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
