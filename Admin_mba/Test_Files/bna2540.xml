&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cashless Economy means using virtual money i.e., the digital payments for our day to day activities. Doing digital transations requires excellect technologies that have to be followed by all the people of the country. Usage of this method shows how advanced and how developed a country is. Cashless transations has many advantages to it. People need not have to carry lot of cash everywhere and have the fear of thefts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a country like India, where the rural areas are not that techonologically sound, government will take measures for proper reach of technology to such areas as well, there by encouraging and helping them learn the usage of digital payments. There are a lot of illegal activities going in rural and backward regions regarding the transations pertaining to goods and services due to the lack of knowledge of perople in such areas. Going cashless and having digital transations will help avoid such injustice to people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For doing digital transactions, the individuals need to have a unique id and password which helps the payments to be secure. Thus, it helps avoid illegal transactions and loosing cash from banks, etc. By using digital payment options, people need not worry about having small change or paying more due to lack of small change as digital payments helps have a exact transaction of amount.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now-a-days every small vendor is also maintaining a digital wallet or any other digital payment option, thus making it easy for every customer. Digital payments are very easy to use and requires just a mobile phone or gadget with internet connection and linking it to the authenticated bank account of the individual. Basic knowledge about the usage of phone is required.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital transactions helps avoid waiting in queues for long time and saves a lot of time and energy. payment of evrything including phone bills, taxes, rent, purchasing tickets and many more can happen through digital payments. Digital payments helps improve the E-Commerce and M-Commerce of our country. Our government has been trying to achieve this by inculcating various schemes and policies, one of which is Digital India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there are many advantages to this way of transations, there are even few disadvantages to it. Convincing people to go cashless and adapt digital payments method is a huge task as most of the people are habituated to the traditional method of transactions and are not ready to adapt change. As the technologgy in today`s world is changing rapidly, imbibing to the new technology and changing very frequently is also a costly affair sometimes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the disadvantages, the other disadvantage is that as the technology is growing, the usage for the betterment and the usage for destruction has also been growing. There are people who are trying to hack the accounts which is very dangerous and casues loss of money and even the personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all these, going cvashless and using digital transations always is very helpful to the customers, vendors and to many business activities and to the government as well. It caters to the economy of the country and helps India stand in the race of global markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Due to modernization, there will be a radical change in the market by 2020. The usage of smart elevators will contribute to most of the modernization revenue by 2020. China alone has roughly around 53% of the upcoming high-rise projects globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a rapid increase in high-rise building around the world due to its fast, comfortable, efficient and secure features. In addition, worldwide green infrastructures standards and statutory requirements are playing a ket role in compelling usage of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting from the usage of traditional elevator system in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, France has been major contribution to the revenue of smart elevator market. New deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more 52% of overall smart elevator market revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many advanced features such as integrating intelligent communication, access control, and security technology enables smart elevator to meet the needs of various usage types such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality. Smart elevators can be customized according to the customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ther is a significant increase in the population residing in cities. As there are geographical limitations in the expansion of cities, they are ecpanding vertically which is eventually increasing the demand for the usgae of smart elevators. The global vendors are concentrating more on the smart elevartor markets then the conventional vertiacl transaportation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these smart elevators are used for many commercial applications such as&amp;nbsp; multiplexes, malls hotels, financial institutions, they are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevators usually consume large amount of energy so the giant players in the market of the smart elevators are trying to research for more new solutions that would consume less power and eneegy and wouyld give the same efficient and effective performance that would satisfy the customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
