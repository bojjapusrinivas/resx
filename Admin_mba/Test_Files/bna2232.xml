<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;3/12/2016 10:17:04 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making people aware is important, but more important is to convert awareness into action. Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Attitude is everything. Only preaching does not help in achieving anything. It must be put into action. Hence putting into action plays a major role than bringing awareness among people. Our government is taking many steps and trying to bring many policies and programs to bring cleanliness. Some among them are Swach bharath, cleaning river Ganga, trying to improve public sanitation facilities and so on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; But it is not possible only if government tries to bring some policies. They must be accepted by the citizens of the nation and should provide their wholehearted support to it. Not only support, but also they must be willing to implement it by putting their efforts. Even government officials and other personnels have to play their part well for the execution and implementaton. Effective implementation and continuous effort to improve it will lead to the sucess of those programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Bringing awareness about cleanliness to everyone is significant especially in rural and backward areas so that they could improve their standard of living. Awareness about various contagious diseases due to uncleanliness and &amp;nbsp;how vital it is to be clean and tidy must to be spread in the minds of every citizens. Only government is not responsible to bring awreness, anyone who is really concerned about the society can voluntarily do that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Individuals should not think that it is someones duty to clean our surroundings. Everyone must take their own interest in cleaning their own surroundings. It is not possible only if they do it for one day and forget about it. It must be a part of routine. Only then it is possible to bring the change. It is all depended on the attitude of the individuals and how they are going to take the things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; For a healthy society and clean India, there must be a positive attitude among citizens and must be ready to contribute their part for the wellbeing of the Nation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; "Lets hope for a better, clean and healthy nation where action speak more than words!!"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
