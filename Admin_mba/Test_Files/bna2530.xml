&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In Today`s world. all payment transactions are cashless by using technologies. All digital payments like payment of bills, transfer of money through electronic device. In 2000 to till now, we use digital devices for all the purpose like shopping, for advertisement about the product and services. The main purpose of the digital payments is easy for the people to make payments through online by using their electronic devices without holding any cash on hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology has been rapidly growing fast as we can make all the cashless transactions through electronically. Digital payments is also refered as web payments or online payments. Yes I quite agree with the&amp;nbsp; digital payments are secure enough for the Indian economy to go cashless because now a days, people are making payments through electronically in which their bank account is linked with the apps and can make any kind of transactions. Applications such as paytm, ebay, mobile banking, phonepay, etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main advantage of making digital payments such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Easy to operate electronic device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Time consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Less cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. From any place we can make payments digitally without any cash on hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also have disadvantages for making payments digitally such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. There must be internet connection on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. As it is not fully secure because people has to link their bank account with the respective payment apps by giving their account number, pin, password, etc. This is the major problem to make digital payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the announcement of demonetisation by prime minister of India Narendra Modi on an unscheduled time at midnight on 8 november 2016. Modi announced that old banknotes of rs.500 and rs.1000 of Mahatma Gandhi series will not be accepted and issuance of new banknotes of rs.500 and rs.2000 of Mahatma Gandhi series will be exchanged with the old notes.With the announcement of exchanging notes people are facing many problems for cash as they have to stand in a queues to get cash from the ATMs and banks. With this I conclude that, people can use technology to make payments without holding cash and can save their time and costs. I have mentioned about the demonetisation above because if people may know how to use technologies they will not face any problems to make any kind of payments. They can easily operate their device and save time and energy. now a days latest technologies are implemented for business and industries. With this they can increase their productivity by using such latest technologies to get profit and as well as for its GDP growth rate for the economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic is all about Smart Elevator Market system. In modern times, existing elevator systems are more advanced by the implementation of latest technologies. Introduction of the smart elevator market systems is expected to grow more by using modern technologies as per the comfort zone of the customers and for the development of the Asian countries. In the above paragragh mentioned that China alone accounts 53% of the upcoming high rise projects.&amp;nbsp; As we can see the raising of buildings has escalated with the demand of customer for fast, comfortable, secure and efficient. Such developed countries like U.S, U.K, Canada and France has developed smart elevators with modern technologies so far for market revenue. As a result, with the introducton of latest technologies with a several features will adopt for smart elevator by upcoming high rise buildings with new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the introduction of latest technologies with advanced features and integration of intelligent communication and to access control and security for smart elevators to the customers needs of various end use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industries and in hospitals, etc as of the requirements of custom of each segments and provide reliability, hygiene, ride and destination control, space and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54% of the total world population as compared to 34% in 1960s. As there is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. If we compare with Todays world 2015-2020, cities across 1.8% growthb in population every year. Schindler Elevator Corporation have been successfully completed the installation of PORT Elevator technology. ThyssenKrupp&amp;nbsp; were mainly focused on installing smart elevator and integrated capabilities of the systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as to improve maintenance service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;where commercial application for smart elevators are being used for offices, hotels &amp;amp; lodgings , healthcare, financial insttutions and retail markets. In healthcare sector, hospitals are required to use modern advanced technologies for the comfortable and need of the patients. Advancement of new features in technologies reduce the time and energy consumption by development of the multi elevator smart technology and it take less power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
