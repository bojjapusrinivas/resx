&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cashless economy is something wherein the economy is lacking with the money problem. It is like where each and every source is linked with the economy. Economy is a science, an art where goods and services are bought and sold in the market. In case of cashless economy the goods and services which are bought from different sources are being affected with the cashless economy. The goods and services bought are demanded high in the markets, due to this the economy is affected badly in the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The cash which is been sourced to various services, departments, schemes, etc. are badly affected with the cashless economy. It means that the cash which is generated from different sources is not particularly given to that schemes or departments. The Indian economy is widely being affected with the cashless economy where huge projects which are to be undertaken are not properly getting the income from the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;For overcoming this problem the Government should undertake some necessary measures. The government should get income from various sources to fulfill the needs of the people who are living in our country. Money is the basic one where a human being can survive in this world, without money there is nothing for a human being to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Payments means the payments which is being through online using Internet. Digital Payments are playing a very important role in the economy, where many people in our country are going through digital payments. It saves lot of time and efforts of the people. Digital payments are sometimes highly secured and at the sametime they are insecured. They may be sometimes hacked by the users or clients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment can be done through online, either mobile, or using mail. The payment which is done through mobile, sometimes the mobille number can be hacked by the users, this may cause a huge problem for the economy in going through cashless economy. Sometimes digital payments may be highly secured by using the passwords and security alerts. This helps the economy in not getting through cashless economy.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our economy is still a developing one, so the government should implement important measures in helping our country to become a developed country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the time of elections, the politicians gives huge lots of the money to the people by wasting the money, it may cause a very big problem to the economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the problem of cashless economy, the middle class and lower class people are highly affected where they donot have enough money to live.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They impose heavy taxes and returns, and get heavy incomes from different sources.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main disadvantage of cashless economy is the government imposes heavy prices on the goods that are to be bought in the market where it may become a problem for the people in the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;The present market is being expected to grow globally world wide which is driven by the existing modernization and is experiencing a radical change by 2020.Wherein developing Asian countries, the deployments of the smart elevators could be potentially takeover the revenue by 2020, where China alone accounts for nearly 53 percent of the upcoming high rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Globally there is a huge rising in the high-rise buildings in which it has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system.They are involving worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements which may help them in compelling the deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the developed countries such as U.S, UK, Canada, and France the modernization of the conventional elevators would be a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue, and the upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt the deployment of smart elevator systems which would develop the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be advanced technological features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology which enables the smart elevators to use the needs of various end-user segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial, hospitality and can be provided with the excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a significant change, in 2014 where the urban people accounted for 54% when compared to 34% in 1960 among the total world population. And during 2015-2020 the estimates would be 1.8% growth in population every year. With the limitation of geographical expansion the cities would result in vertical growth and would lead to greater number of high-rise projects which will eventually trigger for more efficient smart elevators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this competitive era, the global vendors of vertical transportation are focussing more on the smart elevators. ThyssenKrupp, maintains nad manages more than 1.1 million elevators which has integrated cloud capabilities to its systems where the smart elevators would gather valuable data and information about systems and sensors which can improve its maintenance service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotels and lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail markets in which the elevators differs in all the sectors like buildings have lesser inter floor traffic compared to the commercial buildings whereas in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers and, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses and the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the elevators consume lots of energy and therefore , giant players in the market are innovating solutions which consumes less power and provides same customer experience.The smart technology focusses on the operational efficiency during the peak hours and on the other hand maximizes the energy reduction during the full times.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
