&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The plastic&amp;nbsp; materials we use in our day to day life are simply made of a chemical compound called "polyethene", which is very cheap and has&amp;nbsp; large applications hence it plays a major role in a countrys economy.&amp;nbsp; As result there are trillions of plastic producs are manufatured and more than that are throwed on the streets, oceans everyday.&amp;nbsp; There was a time when plastic was considered as a boon to mankind but as the time passes the boon to mankind turned into a death toll to other living organisms in the nature.&amp;nbsp; Can anyone one imagine the future without plastic ? Science and Technology, healthcare technology, automobile industry, food industry, etc. each and every small thing require plastic in one way or the other.&amp;nbsp; Hence,&amp;nbsp; governments, organisations started single-use plastic ban, but the questions that comes to everyones brain is, "is the the ideal solution, can we balance the economy, etc.".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The root cause of this whole situation is a quality that polyethene has which is, it cannot decompose naturally in a short time or altleast it take some hundres of years to decompose it naturally.&amp;nbsp; Hence, when we throw plastic materials, they just stay in dumpyards, oleans, rivers etc for hundreds of years.&amp;nbsp; This puts the life of other living organisma such aquatic animals, domestic animals in misery as plastic is not digestible by living organisms.&amp;nbsp; As a relust every billions of qauatic anims lose their life being victims of plastic.&amp;nbsp; We all understood that any harms man does to nature a ten times of that is done to man by nature.&amp;nbsp; So, there is an urgent need to rectify this problem in an effective way.&amp;nbsp; Here effective way means not just banning plastic totally but to 100% recycling of plastic means not a single carrybag goes into the streets or oceans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;We are right here in this do or die situation, where we have to take groundbreaking measures to balance Economy and Environment.&amp;nbsp; Banning of plastic simply results in need of an alternative which is not there hence so many industries will shut which directly results in economy teardown.&amp;nbsp; So banning plastic is like a&amp;nbsp; out of syllabus question , we should not think of it.&amp;nbsp; What we can do is to create rules, build recycling plants, public friendly plans to recycle plastic etc.&amp;nbsp; Lets say a plastic product is bought by a person, after some time the product is of no use to the person, in this situation&amp;nbsp; instead of throwing it out, collect all the plastic waste in the house and sell it to a recycler at some price fixed by government.&amp;nbsp; Thus, even the waste makes money.&amp;nbsp; This kind of more and more thoughts has to be implements which in turn provide employment oppurtunities for so many people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;May be we have not started using plastic with the intention of reaching present situation but now we have move in a direction which leads us out of the present situtaion.&amp;nbsp; Not only plastic, any existing or new invention of mankind should not only beneficial to human but also nature or atleast not nature distructive,&amp;nbsp; thats called real develepment and may be nature also helps us back as it always does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#############&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 14pt;"&gt;Smart elevators, the future of the overall market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"&gt;In the present scenario, smart elevators market is growing with high pace as the commercial applications of smart elevators are also increasing.&amp;nbsp; Commercial applications such as MNC`s, five star hotels, corporate hospitals, financial institutions and also retail places such as malls and multiplexes etc.&amp;nbsp; have differednt requirements such as deeper elevators for hospitals, high capacity and vandal proof material for elevators for commercials places.&amp;nbsp; So in this case smart elevators are the only solution because of their wide range of applications. Smart elevators consume less energy compared to normal elevators, therefore, a big plus for the buyers.&amp;nbsp; In the near future the buildings will be technically advanced and intilligent so there is need to integrate intuitive technologies into new lifts such as connectivity, both vertically and horizontally enabled elevators.&amp;nbsp; In U.S. and China smart elevators witnessed a high demand in order to modernize the existing elevators along with the huge demand in maintenance sysytems such as smart features,&amp;nbsp; passenger security and less malfunctioning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
