If at all production cost of eco-friendly products is little more than normal products we have to select eco-friendly for better future.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;COMPLEMENTARY GOODS: We have to focus on complementary goods for the&amp;nbsp;products &amp;nbsp;which are bad to the environment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;DISPOSE OF WASTAGE AND SCRAP :&amp;nbsp;Industrial wastage should not dispose in the public area or in the river.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;CLEAN AND GREEN:&amp;nbsp; Each country should follow clean and green programme for one week in every year for cleaning the wastage and planting the trees.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;AWARENESS : Government should conduct awareness programmes regarding how to save the environment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;SELF RESPONSIBILITY : Every citizen should feel that protection of environment is our responsibility.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT : Research should conduct to find the real and indirect causes which are effecting environment badly. Research can give proper and innovative methods to solve the problem effectively and efficiently. There is much need of&amp;nbsp; innovative products which could not effect the environment .&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;ADAPT: Adapt the steps which developed countries are practising for environmental protection with out effecting the development.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;NEW METHOD OF PRODUCTION : Instead of old production methods which are effecting the environment We should develop new method of production. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;SEPARATE BUDGET: We should allocate some money for environmental protection and should use it effectively.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
