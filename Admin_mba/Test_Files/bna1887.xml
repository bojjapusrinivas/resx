List out and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;As per &amp;nbsp;my view working from home is necessary in only some situations like if the people who are handycapped,housewifes,pregnents ladies,who stays regulary at home.These people can work from home.The people how are working from home doesnot have any contact with their collegues.In that situations &amp;nbsp;to clarify those mistakes it became a difficulty. We cannot gain knowlege and &amp;nbsp;our brains works only on one narrow path creativity cannot be developed.We cannot develop self respect and self image by working from home.If we work from office from word of mouth or by discussing with collegues we can gain more knowledge.By getting knowledge we can improve ourself.Brains thinks in a different way so that we can create something.Experience is really very important in life from this we can learn knowledge.This experience and knowledge cannot come easily by sitting in one place without taking insights from other.Even insights can be given by our friends or family members that does not become any useful because,Company is a place were different kinds of knowledge is place in one area.EG:In a company there are different strings like finance,marketing,production,manufacturing.procurement,warehousing all he departments are involved here so by doing work from home we could not get any basic idea from all these departments.Working from home cannot create professionalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
