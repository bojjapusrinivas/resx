<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;12/7/2012 4:02:07 PM&lt;br /&gt;Write briefly about yourself before you proceed with the Test Topic. &lt;br /&gt;Iam Saikishoreje Dunukunala, completed my Masters&amp;nbsp;of Pharmacy in pharmaceutics specialisation. I had qualified for GATE Exam and completed my Masters through that scholarship in Smt.Sarojini ramulamma college of Pharmacy. Iam a native of Suryapet but at present iam living in Hyderabad. I have been working as assistant professor on contract basis in SLC college of Pharmacy.My Father is a&amp;nbsp;retired employee and mother is house wife.&amp;nbsp;Iam ready to work as a trainee in any field. My strengths are willingness to learn new things, Self confidence,hardworking,disciplined. Iam a simple, kind hearted nature of person and I like to meet close friends and discuss my deep issues with them and like to meet people inorder to increase my world view. Although by being with them for alot of time makes me depreciated than i will go out to refesh me again by studying good books, going on to quite self meditation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than one billion Indians: Is this is a problem &amp;nbsp;or a sea of opportunities? Please take a stand and discuss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In India,the population rate has already crossed one billion and in my opinion such a huge population is a problem.The problem is not only in case of job oppurtunities despite there&amp;nbsp;were alot of problems in case of general human needs like food,water, shelter etc. For such a huge population the government has to&amp;nbsp;provide alot.This dependence almost reflects the country economy. we already know that our country is a developing country and still needs to get develop. This makes some sense regarding the increase in the economy rate. But it is not observing; in such a moto it is better to undergo some population restricting plans by governments like family planning, inorder to control birth rate. Although&amp;nbsp; the planning programs had decreased the birth rate percentage alittle in this year&amp;nbsp;compared to any other annual report; but&amp;nbsp;birth rate is still more than death rate.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Due to increase in population, there is increase in need for food but at present there is no such increase in farming rate has been observed. Therefore India has to import the rice, wheat etc from other countries.Therefore it declines the country economy&amp;nbsp;because such alot is paid for the import. As in case of job oppurtunities, there is alot of struggle to get a job because of lot of competition is&amp;nbsp;observed in at present situation. The population rate in many places has increased beyond their limits. Although the increase in farming is going to decline and human needs has became more demandable and therfore the cost of&amp;nbsp;goods has been increased. This vulnerable&amp;nbsp;situation for for human needs like&amp;nbsp;food, water, shelter etc&amp;nbsp;had become to put its pressure on inidan economy and therefore made it more declining&amp;nbsp;the indian economy. Beyond this there&amp;nbsp;are some oppurtunities which are negligible; but beneficial to government. It is related to taxes&amp;nbsp;the people pay to the government. These problems are also due to lack of jobs in some cases and in some lack of education. There are some other countries with more populous than us eg: China, Japan etc&amp;nbsp;became developed nations. The main reason for this is well and good education and the job oppurtunities provided by the government&amp;nbsp;to the people.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;I hereby conclude that the increase in population in our country&amp;nbsp;has a alot of problems compared to its oppurtunities.Therefore more than&amp;nbsp;one billion indians is a problem than the sea of oppurtunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
