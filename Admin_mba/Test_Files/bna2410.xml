&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The bullet trains are fast moving tranis. Its speed is very high as compared to the normal passangers train. I think better trains are for passangers ofcourse both are for the passangers but as compared the bullet trains are more useful why because the India population was morethan 121 crores in that alots of people where travelling from one place to another, for them journey should be very pleasent but not boring. So, the bullet trains are better for the population in India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The first train route was from mumbai to thane from there they are improving now in very state we have train facility and railway track to travel. In &amp;nbsp;every state they are people who are working,studing and they are willing to travel by trian due to trafficjams on the roads becauase of that they are late to they destinations. so if we have a facility of using bullet train then we can reach to office and college on time. At present sutiation India need bullet trains, for these they have to purchase huge infrastructure and spend more amount for purchasing the infrastrucutre.These train works on electricity so for that they have to generate electricity for producing electricity they use resourceslike wind,water and coal. In that case India should have plelnty of water for producing electricity. As we know india has 1/4 of land and 3/4 th of water but in that we cant use whole. The water which are store in dams,resorviros are used for the electrilcity that water which are stored was not sufficient to produce elctricity so, to increase the water level we want heavy rains to fill them but it is not possible because of global warming.Through wind we can generate but there is no proper formula or process to generate electricity.They are workimg out on that will come in soon that process.Coal was extracted from underground but it is sufficient to homes and industries. In India one is interlink with another so for that reasons still we see bullet trains in some places but not all over the India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The bullet trains were used in cousmopolitian cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Banglore,and Delhi. Here the bullet trains were used because there working people are more. In Mumbai huge population, bollywood actres were there, Industries and transpotation of goods through yamuna river. For travelling and goods shifiting the bullet trains were used for the convience.Now a days there increased people who were travelling so that trains were not sufficient to them and that state were trying to increasing they efficiency itseems. In Chennai there are alot of people who are working and this state has first position in population all over india. so there these trains were used. coming to the banglore it is for software industry and alomst all softwares are over there so there these bullet trains are for they convience. Delhi, this state is for politices and also it is key state for India.there we have a fast versions of bullet train.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;These Bullet trains were only in cosmopolitian city but not in other. so now In every state if we have its better of the convience of the people. Generally these trains were used for the tavelling of people but for goods it used then the customers or industries will get on time they material.And they shift to railway transportation instead of road.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;There are some advantages and disadvantages for these bullet trains &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Advantages are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The polution will control on roads &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The people will feel comfort in travelling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;For these the railway industry gets profits &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The life of the passengers is safe&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The passengers will reach on time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Disadvantages&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The installation cost was more&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The utiliasation of resources were more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In my view the bullet trains are more useful in India as compared but every bullet train should be like a better train.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
