Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;CLEAN INDIA-SWATCH BHARAT:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Our honourable prime minister Narendra Modi launched this movement on Oct 2nd(on Gandhi jayanthi) 2014.The motto is to clean and to become hygine country with in his ministery period i.e (2014-2019).With the help on nine leaders Modi started the movement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Modi wants to prove &amp;nbsp;his willingness to develop our country.The dream of mahatma Gandhi is now prime minister is putting in to an action.Modi himself take the oath to make India as a developed country .Many celebrities are participated in this campaign.Ministers to general public,actors to spiritual leaders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Each and every individual should be responsible for this campign.To get &amp;nbsp;interest to the general public, The government is making beautiful designs of dust bins in rail way stations,Bus stations to attract people to throw wastage in to it. There is a saying that CLENLINESS IS NEXT TO GODLYNESS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Even though the government is taking many steps to this campaign we see many are irresponsible to do the work.Government is also providing two dust bins for every house to throw garbages, one is for dry wastage and the other is for wet wastage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The above saying is absolutely correct that is Making people aware is important,but more important is to convert awareness in to action. For example :smoking is injurious to health that is to aware the people to stop smoking, but most important is that the person is to realize that is really injurious to health and he has to put it in to an action to stop smoking.The campaign says not only to clean but also to plant trees.With the help of the plants we are &amp;nbsp;taking &amp;nbsp;oxygen.So we never forget the value of trees.That`s why CLEAN INDIA GREEN INDIA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Every individual should take the initiative and clean our own premises to avoid diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Plant more trees to take natural air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Finally,Developing country turns in to Developed country with the help of each and every citizen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
