&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Well i would like to start with ,trains are the only way of means where we can travel anywhere in India and it is the chepaest mode of transportation and most of them would like to prefer to travel in trains.so,keeping mind about it India as a developing country firstly,as a primary measure &amp;nbsp;it needs better trains i whould like to tell this because as of my knowledge, i &amp;nbsp;hardly travelled five to six times in train where i felt that &amp;nbsp;there is no proper &amp;nbsp;maintance and in trems of security issues also there is no proper security. we usually see that lot of train accidents happen one of the reason would be,as those railway tracks are laid long ago. there is a high chance that sometimes railways would not be able reach to all the places but there should make sure to reach and verify security aspects throughly . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Though, the concent authority ie., central government works in the contineous &amp;nbsp;improvement of walefare as of which it had been diveded into varoius&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;divisions that is south central railways, north central railways and soon.. this is because as the government needs to improve in each and every aspect and to have the wide spread all over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: small;"&gt;we have the Railway Budget it is good that the Government is allocating huge amount every year for various resources but it should even make sure that the amount is utilised in the right manner. we can even find that there are many place in India there is no rail road (railway track).I even read some ware that there are many railways projects are pending as huge amount is needed it should be properly planned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; railways earn huge amount &amp;nbsp;of profit in terms of business, railways are the best mode of transporatation of goods form one place to another in order to run the business sucessfully, but sometimes goods are also damaged because of the neglence of people they may not handle it proper way i can tell this because ones it happened to transport our goods from vijayawada to hyderabad so all our goods were damaged we didn`t receive it a proper condition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Bullet trains are also necessary in India because it shows out advancement, As of &amp;nbsp;time concent bullet trains are the best mode of transportaion, where we living in fast forward generetion every thing has to move on quickly &amp;nbsp;usually, people does not like to wait for long hours even though there have proper and flexible timing to travel they do not avail it because sometimes trains does not come and time they may reach they destenation &amp;nbsp;late so they use there own mode of transporation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I would like to conclude that, India as a developing country need both the Bullet trains as well as the better trains.&amp;nbsp;but it should concentrate on the public satisfication and provide the best.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
