&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="underline"&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Market Overview OF Smart Elevator:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;With the mordenization &amp;nbsp;of existing elevator systems, the market for Smart Elevator is expected to experience a huge growth and a also quick shift by 2020 which will lead Smart Elevator to grow significantlt in global market. so, with the growth in global market there wil be &amp;nbsp;new number of deployments in Asian Countries which are under developing stage, the new deployment numbers of smart elevators can lead to much higher revenue by 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In recent times as the number of high-rise building is increasing in global level , standard of living has also changed, people now wants luxury which comprises of comfort, efficient, fast and secure system. so, need for smart elevators increasing on peoples demad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Market Revenue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;With the modernization of elevator systems in countries like U.S., U.K., Canada, and France Smart Elevator has contributed a lot in market revenue till datew.stll, as high-rise buildings are comming up more it would lead to new deployment. As there will be new deployment of Smart Elevators it would cross its revenue segment which is now and wouls contribute more than 52%in the overall market revenue of smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Technological Advancement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Over the period of time there has been technological advancements which has lead to new features, intelligent communication, access controls and better security technology. With this technological advancements there is a new way where in customisation can be done according to end user segments, eg:Residential, Commercial, lealthcare industrial, etc, everybody can opt for their way and it can be customised accordingly. Smart Elevators with its customised option for end user segment provides excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics. comfort, pace, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold" style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Market Growth in commercial application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Market Growth of Smart Elevator will prove a boon with commercial application &amp;nbsp;in the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Smart Elevators used commercialy in places like offices, hotels&amp;amp;lodges, healthcare, Financial Institutions and in malls, multipplexes.. As every area has its own needs so the design and capacity depends on the area where it is being used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;we can consider the capasity and size of an elevator will be different from residential(as it will be small in size as number os people using it will be less) whereas in malls and hospitals it will be big as number of people will be more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;As elevators consume more power in large commercial buildings where there is more floords connected. Therefore Smart Elevatorsare innovating solutions that wopuld consume less power and greater custemer experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
