&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Some years back, when people wake up in the morning there were pleasant morning with fresh air, energy which makes a person full energetic. But it is very sad to say as today when people wake up in the morning we have pollution air around us. Yes we are growing and growing day by day but In that growth we are unable&amp;nbsp; to see the death of our Mother Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;There are many reasons for this changes in which using of Plastic is one of the dangerous reason. People for their comfortability are even ready to do anything. Plastics or we can say The Monster which is eating our Earth day by day are neither dissolve in soil nor can be burnt properly. The result is it is been in the soil for years and years without dissoving and which later on brings very severe problems like the imbalance in nature activities, increase of methane in air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Many camoaigns are running everyday to stop the usage of plastics. Seeing thiis the Government has taken serious actions to ban the Plastic. But still it is not taking a single step back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Yes it is not possible to ban it all of sudden but we can take several steps to make it less use like using of cloth bag instead of plastic bag, educating the people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;The best example is the current situation of our Capital- Delhi which is surrounded by poisonous smoke. The situation is so worst that people have to pay for oxygen. The smoke in which somewere using of large amount of plastic is also one of the reason. If still we won`t stop it will totally spoil our Environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;If we want our children and the next generation to breathe fresh air and live happily we have to take ban plastic totally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In this fast growing and advanced world, there is no time for an individual to&amp;nbsp; stand and think for a while. Life has become so fast that there is no single second to be spared.. Nowadays Technology is saving humans time and energy in every corner of life. We are using Smart Phones, smart T.V, smart Refrigerator, smart A.C.....and so on.........And for this generation Smart Elevators are one of the Boon for Humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;There is no such place left where this Smart Elevators cannot be used. It can be used in the Hospitals.Offices, hotels, Railway stations,Malls and Multiplexes etc....The very best part of this Smart Elevators are its design. The design is different and it is according to sectors, if it a housing society where the Elevator is being planned then based on the capacity of the population of the building it is designed. If it is for a commercial use then based on the population it is designed. Smart Elevators are very much useful for the Hospitals for patients, so the Elevators designed for Hospitals are more spacious with more speed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The main purpose of the Smart Elevator is to save time and give a comfortabie ride to the passengers to their destination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Normal Elevators consumes huge amount of energy based on the usage of the Elevators and based on the purpose of being build. The usage of Elevators are very high in commercial areas.But as Technology is helping and supporting humans in each level there is a solution for this also and that is `SMART ELEVATORS`.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Smart Elevators market value will increase globally from the curent market value. One of the factor is because of the extraordinary design and construction. Smart Elrevators are technically advanced brilliant buildings along with advanced technology like security alerts,energy efficiency and repair schedules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Other factors like improving the overall compurter experience and adaption of cable- free lifts which can move both vertically and horizontally .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;As the world is modernizing day by day the demand of Smart Elevators is increasing of because if the Infrastructure Transformation , passengers security and safety and reduced malfunctioning benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#################--Don`t Delete below content#################&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;,&amp;#96;serif&amp;#96;; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;,&amp;#96;serif&amp;#96;; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;,&amp;#96;serif&amp;#96;; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;,&amp;#96;serif&amp;#96;; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;,&amp;#96;serif&amp;#96;; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"&gt;The worldwide smart elevators market is set to grow exponentially from its current market value. A driving factor is said to be increased spending on the construction of technically-advanced and intelligent buildings along with the integration of connectivity technology and internet features into elevators. These include enhanced security, energy efficiency, and alerts related to repair schedules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;,&amp;#96;serif&amp;#96;; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"&gt;The intuitive technologies integrated into new lifts, such as connectivity and smart grouping, is expected to improve the overall commuter experience. Also, adoption of cable-free lifts that can move both vertically and horizontally are other factors spurring market growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;,&amp;#96;serif&amp;#96;; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;"&gt;Modernization of the lift systems in existing buildings is witnessing a steady demand in the smart elevators market due to infrastructure transformation initiatives in countries including the U.S., China, etc. The lift maintenance systems in the smart elevators market is experiencing a huge demand owing to intelligent features, passenger security, and reduced malfunctioning benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
