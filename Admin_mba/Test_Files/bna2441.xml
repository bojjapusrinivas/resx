&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;In my view &lt;span class="bold"&gt;India needs Bullet Train and as well as Better trains&lt;/span&gt;. Because, the bullet trains cannot be affored by all the people. &amp;nbsp;Mainly coming to the poor people as they cannot afford. &amp;nbsp;Richer and the corporate cultured people can be preffered mostly for this bullet train as they are very well knowledgable about various things in the country. &amp;nbsp;And, as India is a still developing country there is need of innovation of new technologies while compared to others. &amp;nbsp;The bullet train are very useful to the businees people in doing thier work on time by reaching the places wherever they are expected to go. &amp;nbsp;The people shall also be convinient with whatever facility they want to adopt. &amp;nbsp;According to the nature of the people they are used to decide and mostly, people prefer travelling in the railways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The way the India is developing it needs bullet train to grow the economy at faster pace with the innovation of new technologies with the trains. The bullet train are much important in today`s world as the living standadrds of the people is more. &amp;nbsp;But the needy people requires the better trains as they are convinient with those facilities like the people who are coming from villages and they can afford accordingly. As, the Bullet train can be connected to the various stations with the different facilities so that they can reach the destination at the faster mode. As nowdays most of the people are changing accrodingly with the various technologies they can easily adopt with the new innovations as they are not money minded, they are going to spend easily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;According to the people and based on thier requirements they use the transport facility and whichever is the safest, convinient, affordable, thier capability. &amp;nbsp;In the current scenario the India should be able to develop it`s country by using various technologies &amp;nbsp;and the innvoations keeping in view of the public and thier standards of living. So that, thier will be no incovinience with the people whatever they may be adopting. &amp;nbsp;By using the bullet trains it will be helpful to the Business and the Corporate people in the current scenario. &amp;nbsp;As, these bullet train saves the time of the people so they are able to reach on time for thier meetings or any other work. &amp;nbsp;The better trains are useful for the vacation purposes and the village people, or who want to go out of the stations and spend thier thier free time the better trains are helpful. And as these better trains are afffordable by everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;As compared to other countries India is still a developing country, the India must focus on the development of technology and come up with the new ideas uniquely when compared to other countries by adding some additional features with whatever the facilities they are coming up with. &amp;nbsp;So that it can be able to implement with which the people can be adopted with reference to the bullet or the better trains with the convinience of the public and the economy. &amp;nbsp;As, India should also focus on the impact of the economy whether it can cope up with the technology used and the usage of it accordingly. &amp;nbsp;The Railway mode of transportation is much more better and cheaper to the other modes of transportation and it is also the fastest mode. &amp;nbsp;So, it is very easy to travel and also the process is done accordingly by the people. &amp;nbsp;Hence it is better to have the both "BULLET TRAIN AND AS WELL AS BETTER TRAINS" Keeping in view the public and the Developement and Welfare of the Indian economy which includes the fullfillment of the people and the living standards of them accordingly. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, it may lead the India as a Develpoing Country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
