Clean India - Is attitude change more important than the movement?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Yes,The theme is obsolutely right because the government of India has been to introduced "Make India clean".In this regard the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has started programme "Swaccha Bharta".This programme has been strenghen in all over india on the words of Prime Minister.This Programme main aim is to keep clean surroundings and environment.In our country upto December 2015 many states are taken this programme as first to clean our state.In this programme the primary duty of human being is to aware the things and should keep clean the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;surroundings and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;environment.The Govenrment of India has released fund to implement Swacch Bharat in all the states to formulate as&amp;nbsp;clean India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;All the states are implementing this programme just namely,but not challengely.Nowadays wherever we go there should be looking ugly,so every individual should take as primary responsibility to clean our nation and should clean our environment.The Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been introduced many awareness Programmes,in his list second programme is "Startup India and Standup India".This programme has launched on the Independance day of 2015.This programme main objective is to aware the youth and to decrease the unemployment in our India.Under the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Startup India and Standup India programme should provide to the unemployed youth from Rs:5,000/- to Rs:1,50,000/&lt;/span&gt;-.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;The Prime&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="example2"&gt;Minister Narendra Modi has called to the indians are should have&amp;nbsp;a Bank Account and after that he has introduced Banking saving Schemes and Insurance Schemes for the Account holders,this is great awareness in our india and also awareness converted into action upto December-2015. Morethan Twelve crore people get their bank Account. And another awareness programme is Aadhar is named as "One indian One Aadhar".Indian should get an Aadhar Card it is given indian identity.Aadhar &amp;nbsp;enrollment almost done all over india upto 85% till date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="example2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In Present days in India the Prime Minister has been introducing many programmes for rural people as well as Urban people,recently the government of India has been decided to change the cities as Smart Cities.In first phase the government has been declared&amp;nbsp;100 Smart Cities in india,its nearly get in year 100crores for development the cities,this is very great decision to change into Smart Cities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="example2"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In my opinion making people aware is important,but more important is to convert awarenes into action is right thing,it will be the primary role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
