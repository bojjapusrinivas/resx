<AnalystsTest><Text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;11/23/2016 12:01:18 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss the pros and cons of the Indian Government&amp;rsquo;s action plan for demonetization of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes. What would be the long term impact of this step on terror financing and creation of unaccounted wealth?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demonetization is the change which India is going through, India has been emerging as a large economy based on the monetary funding be it a FDI or Internal Investments in diversified industries. Narendra Modi Indian Prime Minister has taken steps for curbing lot of black money and eradicate the parallel economy in India. Parallel economy is existant in many contries in europe, Latin America and where as in India Parallel Economy is 22.5% approxmately. Parallel economy currency mainly consists of counterfiet notes and black money by the rich and uber rich. This activity of demonetization pulls the counterfiet currency notes in the banking pool and would have discarding&amp;nbsp;of the same. Any excess of money which is in the denomination of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 would have to be exchanged with Rs. 100 denomination or has to be diposited into the bank accounts. Demonetization helps to pull all the currency with Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 to bank where government can know what excess amount of currency notes are available and what should be the actual number of currency. By doing demonetization, India is able to pull&amp;nbsp;money into the system and have controlled funding activity in the respective businesses. When ever demonetization takes place one has to be very clear that maximum amount of reversal currency is there in the treasury of RBI so as to have a smooth transtioning can be done. If there is lack of the exchange value for the notes that it has a ripple effect on the economy, for ex. virtual money is lying in the form of bank account deposits where as withdrawl is only restricted to Rs. 2000 per day. this gives lot of cash crunch intially in the market so cash turnover transcations has reduced on the contrary online transactions has increased which will help the government track monetary turnover and one cannot evade tax based on the business done. Every day the Notes printing of Rs. 100 and new Rs. 500 Currency has to be printed in order to meet the demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Long term it would have positive impact and cannot have terror financing as every tranction would be kept a track of and when ever the high value transaction is taking place there is a check from the respective banking cell to raise an alarm. It will open up new source of income and benami accounts can also be eradicated. Dismanteling the cash transaction more than Rs. 10000 without the pan card or Aadhar card would curb the accumulation of unaccounted wealth and tax cannot be evaded. All anti social organizations will be cut or curtailed to the online banking transactions which will have source and destinations of the funds transfer which will be accountability of the sender and receiver. Hence manupulation of unaccounted money can rereduced to almost minimal. More of tax paying by every indian and actual amount of income calculation. Based on that more taxes can be collected and tax evasion can be reduced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: green; font-size: large;"&gt;File Name:Smart Elevator Market&lt;br /&gt;Start editing from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Smart elevator is market is expected to go through a radical shift by 2020 and massive increase in growth. Since the new era of moderinization of the elevators that are present in the market now, a paradigm shift is to be expected based on the new deployment which is anticipated in developing asian countries. Most of these high rise projects calls for the smart elevators and smart elevators could increase by the year 2020 as chaina itself has 53% of highrise projects across the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the globe the need for high rise buildings has increased the demand as more space can be acquired in a given peice of land. In recent days demand for fast, comfortable, efficient and has increased and the capacity for the elevations also has been in more demand so as to have more people transported vertically. Worldwide green infrastructure statutory requirements has also increased the deployment of these smart elevators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a need to modernization for the old or conventional elevators in the developed countries like U.S., U.K. Canada , and france have gained the market revenue after the modernization. In due cource of time all high rise buildings will adopt smart elevator systems as a result this would improvise and surpass the modernization segment revenue further leading&amp;nbsp;52% change in the revenue upward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Change in technology is the word today, advanced features, intellegent comm systems, access control and security technology helps smart elevators to cater to residential, commercial, healthcare and hospitality segments. The best part of these smart elevators is that it can be customised as per the unique requirement &amp;nbsp;for excellent reliability, hygine, aesthetics, ride, destination control, space and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban Population is an another reason for a change which is observed in the cities. Way back in 1960 there was 34% of the world population resided in cities but now number has moved to 54%. This is not still and the numbers indicate as per the estimate that every year there would be a growth of 1.8% from 2015 - 2020. Due to the space constraint to expand geographically cities will grow vertically and this will have a result of high rise buildings and in turn to increase in smart elevators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Global vendors are focusing on the smart elevators which would help them keep in the smart elevator market and can be competitive to grab the market attention and its clients. ThyssenKrupp is one of its kind which maintains 1.1 million elevators and has done technological advancements in cloud capability services to aquire data about systems, sensors and which helps in maintainance service. Schindler Elevator corporation is another company which sees at successful instalations where it has used modern port elevator technology at Union Plaza office building in Puerto Rico.&amp;nbsp;Schindler&amp;nbsp;installed smart destiation technology in Bank Of America in Manhattan, The Humana Headquarters in Louisville and the Cresent in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application in commercial areas would prove boon for the overall growth in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercial application of smart elevator are being widely used in offices, hotels and lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions, mall and multiplexes. Design and Capacity differs with the place it is used like in residential its lesser inter floor traffic compared to the commercial buildings. Hospitals need a deeper elevators for stretchers, Commercial capacity need is more, malls and multiplexes require vandal proof meterial. Apart from this there is a need for spacious and ride comfort in retails and warehouses so there is lot of customisations are done from the elevator companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Elevators use large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where inter floor traffic is more so giant players in the market are looking at innovative solutions to have less consumption of power to contribute greener solutions as well with respect to customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi has been innovative in building smart multi elevator technology in 2011 that contributes to 10% less energy consumption. The smart technology focuses on operational efficency during peak hours and simultaniously work on the energy reduction during lull time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Smart Elevator Market &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The global smart elevator market is expected to grow significantly. Driven by modernization of existing elevator systems, the market is expected to experience a radical shift by 2020. With a considerable number of new deployment anticipated in developing Asian countries, the deployments of smart elevators could potentially takeover modernization revenue by 2020. China alone accounts for roughly 53 percent of the upcoming high-rise projects around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Globally, the rising number of high-rise buildings has escalated the demand for a fast, comfortable, efficient, and secure vertical transportation system. In addition, worldwide green infrastructure standards and statutory requirements are instrumental in compelling deployment of smart elevators in new structures and current infrastructures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The modernization of conventional elevator systems in developed countries such as U.S., UK, Canada, and France has been a major contributor to smart elevator market revenue so far. However, over the period, upcoming high-rise buildings would adopt fresh deployment of smart elevator systems. As a result, new deployment of smart elevators would surpass the modernization segment revenue and contribute more than 52% of the overall smart elevators market revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Technologically advanced features and integration of intelligent communication, access control and security technology enables smart elevators to cater to the custom needs of various end-use segments such as residential, commercial, healthcare, industrial and hospitality among many others. Smart elevators can be customized to the unique requirements of each of these end-user segments and can provide excellent reliability, hygiene, aesthetics, ride and destination control, space, and comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;There is a significant change in the number of people residing in cities. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54 percent of the total world population as compared to 34 percent in 1960. The estimates suggest that the shift would level during 2015 &amp;ndash; 2020 and cities across the world would see 1.8% growth in population every year. The limitation of geographical expansion of cities would result in vertical growth, and a greater number of high-rise projects shall be commissioned, which will eventually trigger the demand for more efficient smart elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Global vendors of vertical transportation systems are currently shifting their focus to smart elevators to remain competitive. ThyssenKrupp, which maintains and manages more than 1.1 million elevators, has now integrated cloud capabilities to its systems in order to gather valuable data about systems and sensors as well as improve its maintenance service. In 2014, Schindler Elevator Corporation successfully completed the installation and modernization of its PORT elevator technology at the Union Plaza office building, Puerto Rico. The Hearst Tower and the Bank of America in Manhattan, the Humana headquarters in Louisville and the Crescent in Dallas are some of the buildings where Schindler Corporation has installed its smart elevator destination dispatch technology system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;Commercial application to beef up the smart elevator market growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif;"&gt;The commercial application of the smart elevators market would prove a boon for the growth of the overall market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;The commercial applications where smart elevators are being used are offices, hotel &amp;amp; lodgings, healthcare, financial institutions and retail (malls and multiplexes). The design and capacity of the elevators differs in all the sectors. i.e., residential buildings have lesser inter floor traffic as compared to commercial buildings; therefore, the capacity and the passenger capacity varies; whereas, in healthcare sector, hospitals require deeper elevators to take stretchers. In malls and multiplexes, vandal proof material of smart elevator is required. In addition to this, spacious and ride comfort elevators are essential in retail and warehouses. Therefore, the elevators are designed according to the purpose of the elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Elevators consume large amount of energy in large commercial buildings where there is more inter-floor traffic of people. Therefore, giant players in the market are innovating solutions that would consume less power and provide same customer experience, i.e. Smart Elevators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;#96;Times New Roman&amp;#96;, serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;For instance, Mitsubishi has developed a multi-elevator smart technology in 2011 that reduces energy consumption approximately up to 10%. The smart technology focuses on operational efficiency during peak hours of rush and on the other hand maximizes energy reduction during lull times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
