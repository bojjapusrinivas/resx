Do you think the Bill can help protect people against poverty and insecurity?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;poverty is the main problem of every&amp;nbsp;developing country. india is also facing this problem.due to population,corruption,illiteracy etc are the reasons of poverty.&amp;nbsp;the name itself says its for the security for the people I think it should be brought in so that atleast to some extent we fight against poverty and insecurity.before bringing this bill proper study should be made about the statistics of the bill then it should be brought into existence.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Food security bill should be brought in indian economy so that we find to what extent it would be successful in solving the problems of the economy.this bill should be handled by experts so they lead the team in right direction and resolve the issues related to the problem.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In india we have more number of &amp;nbsp;slum areas where people are jobless,malnourished and home less these areas should be concentrated and these areas should be provided necessary things.even in well developed cities like Hyderabad and Mumbai we see slums neglected.i think every state should work on these areas and find out reasons and provide necessary help and educate them about the facilities provided by the government for the people.even celebrities and well established organisations should come forward to help the government&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In my opinion indian government should bring food security bill so that problems of the people are solved and we fight against poverty and insecurity.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text></AnalystsTest>
