								  <p><strong><a name="faq01"></a>How to apply for the ‘work from home’ option from BizAcumen?</strong> <br/> Please click on the link<span style="font-size:13px; text-decoration:none"><a href="http://www.bizacumen.com/workez/FRM_Biz_FreeLancersNew.asp" class="blue_link"> http://www.bizacumen.com/workez/FRM_Biz_FreeLancersNew.asp</a></span> and fill in our online application.<span class="red"> Please do not post resumes to our office or to any email ID. Only online applications at the given web link are considered.</span></p>


<p><strong><a name="faq02" id="faq02"></a>After sending the online application form, what will be the selection process for work at home? Will there be any online test or an interview?</strong><br/>
Candidates selected from the online applications are given an online test via email. No personal interview is conducted for contract writers. The quality of the online write-up forms the primary basis for offering the online test.</p>

<p><strong><a name="faq03" id="faq03"></a>How do we come to know about our selection in the online test?</strong><br/>

The online test assignment email is the only communication that is sent via email to your personal email ID. All communications thereafter, including intimation about your selection in the online test, are through the test assignment interface personalized to each candidate taking the online test.</p>

<p><strong><a name="faq04" id="faq04"></a>Is the recruitment coordinator accessible via phone or online chat for queries regarding recruitment and selection?</strong><br/>
 Please note our recruitment and selection committee is not structured to provide phone or chat support. Our recruitment team is accessible only by email at <a href='Mailto:hyd@BizAcumen.com' class="blue_link">hyd@BizAcumen.com</a> for all queries related to recruitment into Hyderabad and ‘work from home’ teams. The eNet/Contract writers, upon selection, are provided another email ID for all queries and clarifications.  This way, the applicant deals with only one email ID and gets prompt and efficient responses.</p>
 
<p><strong> <a name="faq04" id="faq04"></a>How long will the ‘work from home’ option exist?</strong><br/>
 The work from home option from BizAcumen has been in existence over the past 10 years and will continue to recruit, train, and employ quality individuals for many more years to come. However, there may be periods of less work or no work for individuals who are not consistent with quality, productivity or deliverability.</p>

<p><strong><a name="faq05"></a>How many MS word pages does the eNet/contract writer need to complete in a day?</strong><br/>
 Although there is no limit on the number of pages that you can complete in a day or a month, we ideally look for at least 50 MS word pages of ‘usable’ edited content in a month. ‘Usable’ here means edited content that is checked and qualified as usable by our in-house quality control team. </p>


<p><strong><a name="faq06"></a>What are the tasks performed by a contract writer?</strong><br/>
 First and foremost, the contract writer has to read and comprehend data provided in the source feed. This will involve thorough reading of the content (including reading between-the-lines), detailed analysis of the situation, and identification of information strategic to the topical area (referred to as relevant information). Subsequent work will involve consolidation of ideas across the given content and presentation of information adhering to the guidelines in formal business expression. The source content has to be rewritten in a creative manner that lacks resemblance to the original idea discussed in the source and at the same time should deliver the same meaning.</p>

<p><strong><a name="faq07"></a>What are the typical industries that a contract writer is expected to write upon?</strong><br/>
 Contract writers are tasked on information relevant to the following industries – Advanced Technologies, Aerospace Industry, Automotive, Banking & Finance, Biotechnology, Clean Technologies, Chemicals & Minerals, Metals & Metal Products, Construction Industry, Consumer Health, Food & Beverage, Clinical Diagnostics, Medical Equipment & Supplies, Pharmaceuticals, Garments & Textiles, Household Products, Information Technology, Machinery, and Services, among others. </p>

<p><strong><a name="faq08"></a>Are contract writers given an opportunity to work on both technical and non-technical projects/assignments? Will they be able to choose from a given set of topics based on their preference?</strong><br/>
Projects are assigned at random from a pool of assignments. However, upon selection, based on a specific request in this regard, contract writers may be given a chance to choose the kind of assignments that they may wish to work on.</p>

<p><strong><a name="faq09"></a>What are the remuneration, and compensation terms for the freelance position?</strong><br/>
 Remuneration will be based on quality of research content generated, number of pages generated and timeliness of delivery. Payment will be made in the form of fees per assignment handled. </p>
 
 <p><strong><a name="faq10"></a>What is the frequency of payments for the work completed and how are the payments made?</strong><br/>
 Payments for qualified/selected candidates are made monthly by direct credit online through their SBI accounts. For disqualified/rejected candidates, payment for the test assignments is made through online credit in the SBI account (if they already have an SBI account) or through an account payee cheque (sent by post) in case they do not have an SBI account.</p>

<p><strong><a name="faq11"></a>Are statutory deductions like provident fund, income tax, professional tax, etc. deducted from the contract writer’s earnings?</strong><br/>
 Provident fund, income tax, and other statutory deductions are not deducted from earnings of contract writers. However, TDS (tax deduction at source) is applicable if total earnings exceed Rs.30,000 per annum.</p>

<p><strong><a name="faq13"></a>What kind of training is provided for the ‘work from home’ eNet/contract writers?</strong><br/>
 Two types of training would be provided to candidates selected from the online test. First is the off-site/online training provided through each candidate’s personal interface, which is mandatory for all applicants opting for the ‘work from home’ option. Second is the on-site training provided at our Hyderabad/New Delhi offices**. Our quality control team comprising of trained individuals with several years of report writing experience provides on-site training for contract writers residing in locations near our Hyderabad and New Delhi offices. The on-site training is optional and is based on the contract writer’s convenience.</p>
 

<p><strong><a name="faq14"></a>What are the written documents to be signed upon selection?</strong><br/>
 Upon selection, the eNet/contract writer needs to send signed copies of the eNet initiation documents by speed post to the address provided by the eNet coordinator. More details about the eNet initiation documents will be communicated upon selection. Contract writers are constantly exposed to proprietary techniques and processes that are considered intellectual property of the company, its affiliates and clients. All ‘work from home’ employees are required to comply with BizAcumen’s non-compete non-disclosure agreement.</p>
 

<p><strong><a name="faq15"></a>Will the contract writer receive an appointment letter upon selection?</strong><br/>
 Appointment letter is given to the contract writer upon selection as part of induction related paperwork.</p>
 
<p><strong> <a name="faq16"></a>Are all the formalities after selection completed via email/post? Is there any formality to be completed that requires the candidate to come to Hyderabad?</strong><br/>
 All formalities and communications after selection are carried out via email/post. No physical presence is required at the Hyderabad office.</p>

<p><strong><a name="faq17"></a>In case a contract writer wants to resign or discontinue, what is the criteria/procedure? Is there any notice period for contract writers?</strong><br/>
 In case a contract writer wants to resign or discontinue, he/she needs to inform the eNet coordinator a week in advance via email and complete his/her current assignment before discontinuation. </p>

<p><strong><a name="faq18"></a>How do we handle our external/freelance editorial partnerships? </strong><br/>
 We have developed a disciplined approach focused around uniquely managing quality and schedule at every step. Our workflow is essentially results driven, although emphasis is laid on schedule, and on-time delivery of projects. All external editorial partnerships ease through a procedure of training and knowledge transfer wherein the documented and prescribed set of protocols and guidelines familiarize the editor/writer about editorial responsibilities, and processes. This structured discovery phase develops and nurtures editorial quality standards, style requirements, and analytical integrity among our established team of outsourced writers/editors.</p>

<p><strong><a name="faq19"></a>How do we value our outsourced editorial talent pool? </strong><br/>
 Our editorial projects being long haul in characteristics, we have vibrant long-term relationships with our external/freelance writers, authors and editors. We consider our skilled outsourced editorial talent pool as people-smart economies of scale that reduce overheads, and increase productivity, and performance. Our outsourced content-driven research support through external/freelance editors/writers/authors is a mature, and long-term initiative. With years of proven efficiency in extending editorial support to our in-house team of researchers and analysts, our network of external/freelance editors/writers/authors operate on lines of a scalable model of systemized workflow.</p>
 

<p><strong><a name="faq20"></a>How does our external editorial staff add value to our research efforts?</strong><br/>
 Our accomplished researchers, analysts, and subject matter experts create, develop, and evaluate research content on a purely technical, and analytical level. The skilled pool of outsourced editorial talent extends the required extra polish and refinement to our content-intensive industry specific research reports, studies and white papers. Our professionally trained editors, who thoroughly acknowledge and understand the power of words, provide suggestions for value additions through proposed improvements in grammar, content structure, editorial changes, re-writing raw source content, suggestions for rewriting, revisions, and content organizational enhancements, and corrections.</p>

<p><strong><a name="faq21"></a>What is the time duration allotted for each report? </strong><br/>
 Since most of the information outsourced is research related, lot of importance and emphasis is placed on the timely deliverability of processed information. Freelance researchers are expected to take on a wide variety of tasks tailored to our specific requirements, including niche level analysis of specific market sectors. In such cases the time duration is contingent on the limited pooled data to be analyzed, and interpreted.</p>
 

<p><strong><a name="faq22"></a>Is location a criterion? </strong><br/>
 Prospective candidates can be located in any major city of India, but must be fluent in English and have computer and Internet access.</p>

<p><strong><a name="faq23"></a>What is the scope for innovation in research reports? </strong><br/>
 Although our reports are structured around an established template, they nevertheless require, and provide ample scope for added innovation and creativity. </p>
